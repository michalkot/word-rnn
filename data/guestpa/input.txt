Hi there, thanks for your question. Yes, you can do it that way; there's a difference though. When you park before your stay, you need to visit the front desk to register your license plate number, and you would also need to pay for the booking in full at that time. It becomes non-cancellable as well once you've parked the vehicle, as you're using part of the package (parking portion)

No, also is booked. However, executive suites are booked tentatively, so maybe they will become available since we don't have 100% guaranteed booking

User:
It's our anniversary this day.

User:
24 yrs, on the 24th, the Golden one

Agent:
Oh congratulations!

Agent:
I'm just taking a look at our website to check the pricing

Agent:
I do see we are selling our Garden Studios at $384 CAD + taxes, but the One Bedroom Suites are at $444 CAD + taxes

Agent:
The One Bedroom Suite has a king bed in the bedroom, and a separate living room. The Studio has the king bed and sitting area all in the one room

User:
Oh, I specifically want the nice room with a decent deck overlooking the inner harbor side, is this that?

Agent:
The One Bedroom Suites with a king bed have a partial water view. Let me see what else we have available that has a good view

User:
ok

Agent:
We do have a One Bedroom Suite with one queen bed (same layout of room) on a high floor with an inner harbour view at the same price

User:
We're both tall, sorry we need a king.

Agent:
Ok, then I might suggest the Studios, as they have a better view than the One Bedrooms. They do still have the balcony with the furniture, and the four piece marble bathrooms

User:
Hold on, I'll look online.

Agent:
They are the ones available at $384 CAD + taxes

User:
I want it to be special, so a larger deck with king is my desire, very nice bathroom in the studio thought.

User:
Bedroom suite have a king bed?

Agent:
Yes, we do have the One Bedroom Suite with a king bed, which is currently what you are reserved in. They only have a partial view of the water though. You can see the water from the balcony, just not from the room itself

User:
The one in the picture online looks like the deck is like 500 Sq. Ft. is that true?

User:
Also what floor is the room I have booked, a higher one is preferred.

Agent:
The suite is about 550 sq feet all together. The balcony is about 150 sq ft

Agent:
These suites are anywhere from the 2-4th floor. I'll note your request for a high floor

User:
Can the Empress be seen from inside the room?

Agent:
No unfortunately not

User:
Which direction of the compass is the room facing? I want to see the city at night from the room.

User:
& yes the Empress, what room do I need for this?

User:
Have I wore out my welcome?

Agent:
Sorry, I was just on the phone with a guest

User:
I have to leave soon & want to get this final. Thanks

Agent:
Your best option for a view of the Empress would be an Erickson Wing Studio. We cannot guarantee it, but this would be your best choice for view of the Empress

User:
Should I move to the executive suite to achieve my desire?

User:
Does that room have a king?

Agent:
Yes, that would be the best view of the City, as you are on the 5th floor with a view of the Inner Harbour

Agent:
The Executive does have a king bed

Agent:
The Executive Suite is about 800 sq feet in size just to give you an idea

User:
Any cheaper options that fit my need?

Agent:
And the balcony is about 200 sq feet

User:
What's my best rate for the Executive?

Agent:
The Executive is selling at $764 CAD + taxes, and we have AAA or Seniors discounts available

User:
We're 56(;}

Agent:
Ok! Well you do qualify, and that would bring the rate down to $687 CAD + taxes

User:
Oh come on, we're ole buddies at this point, through me a bone, a oncve in a lifetime Golden anniversary.

Agent:
I know, but unfortunately the Executive is one of our Specialty Suites, and that is the best discount we have

User:
Am I gonna have to sweep up to get the best rate?

User:
Regardless, let's change my reservation.

User:
I'm feeling executive.

User:
can you send a confirmation to bcampbell@surgentinc.com

Agent:
Yes I will send it to you shortly. You are now confirmed in the Executive Suite

We will be happy to extend you our discounted rate of $399+ taxes per night which total to almost $1400 for 3 nights for the same room type (Superior Suite).  Since your reservation is through a third party, you will need to cancel that reservation through Agoda or Priceline.  You may send us an email at reservations@thetimeny.com to book the $399+ taxes per night directly.  Thank you and please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

User:
Hi,

Agent:
Hi there! There is at least one free walking tour in Copenhagen that starts at RÃ¥dhuspladsen (Town Square / City Hall) which is right in the middle of town and quite close to the hotel. 

This is the most comprehensive of the tours they offer and also the only one before noon - However, these tours go from 10, 11 and 12 AM and last 3 hours, which means you would have to take the one at 10 and then cut it short around 11:30 to be back at the hotel on time for the Wednesday, but on Tuesday you could take any of the three. 

They also offer a daily tour of Christiania from 4 PM, and a 'Classical' Tour of Copenhagen daily from 12 noon, these two tours start from HÃ¸jbro Plads which is very close the the Town Hall

Hope that is of some help :)

Yes of course its always best to book

Agent:
There are a few options in terms of transportation from the airport to the hotel. The easiest is to catch the regional train which takes 15 minutes from the airport to the central station. The hotel is then just a few minutes walk from the station. A taxi from the airport will usually cost anywhere between 250-300 DKK depending on time of the day as well as traffic. There are lots of taxis to catch, so this should be quite an easy solution as well. I hope this was of help to you!

Wonderful thank you. Unfortunately the group rate is no longer available, but I do have a Bedroom suite available. This as I said would have a pull out couch in the living room and one king sized bed in the bedroom. The nightly rate for 3 adults would be $469.00 CAN plus taxes and fees.

Afternoon, just wondering if you have a corporate room (HSE) available on the 8th May B&B - thank you

Agent:
Should you have any questions then please let me know.

Agent:
For May 8, 2018, we do have rooms available. It's currently a better value to reserve a 'room only' booking, and purchase breakfast separately. The best room-only rate for a Deluxe King room would be $245.40 CDN before tax, under our 'Early Bird' promotion. The cruise terminal is in downtown Vancouver; unfortunately we do not have a shuttle running that far. I'm not certain what taxi fare would be, but the ride is I believe about 30 minutes on average. I would recommend speaking with our hotel concierge for more detailed info and suggestions for transportation over to the port.

Good morning and thank you for reaching out.  It all depends on what type of rate you reserve.  For any advance purchase reservation, we usually take payment on the credit card you provide with the reservation.  For most of the other rates/offers, you simply need to guarantee your reservation with your credit card and pay upon arrival.

KÃ¦re Henning, jeg vil gerne assistere dig, men jeg bliver dog nÃ¸dt til at bede dig om at skrive pÃ¦nt, da det faktisk sidder en person her pÃ¥ den anden side af skÃ¦rmen. Hvilken datoer er du interesseret i?

User:
Beklager. Det er ofte for mange rare problemer med online systemer.  MIn ikke sÃ¥ pene uttalelse handler om det automatiske systemet.  Jeg er meget glad for Ã¥ mÃ¸te et menneske. Det er snakk om 24/11 til 25/11 en natt oh et bra rom.

Agent:
Det kan jeg godt klare Henning, jeg gÃ¥r ud fra at du er den samme Henning FjÃ¸s, som har boet her fÃ¸r, sÃ¥ at jeg kan bruge den profil vi har i systemet. Har du brug for enkelt eller doublet room?

Hi Henning, reservationen var jo lavet som jeg lovede. Jeg havde sendt bekrÃ¦ftelsen pÃ¥ email til din mail henning@fjoes.net. Det kunne jo vÃ¦re at den havde landet i papirkurven... og igen vil jeg huske dig pÃ¥ at det faktisk er mennesker som sidder har pÃ¥ den anden side af skÃ¦rmen og derfor er det intet galt ved at skrive pÃ¦nt. SKulle du have nogle problemer er du velkommen til at skrive direkte til mig pÃ¥ grm@andersen-hotel.dk. Jeg vil sÃ¥ tage mig af de klager som vi fÃ¥r, da jeg er Guest Relation manager her i huset. Mvh. LÃ¡ra G. Lindgreen

User:
Den reservasjonen kom aldri til min email. Jeg har ingen "papirkurv".  Jeg forstÃ¥r ikke hva du mener med at skrive pÃ¦nt.  Jeg har ikke gjort annet enn Ã¥ beskrive helt saklig min opplevelse med Ã¥ forsÃ¸ke Ã¥ booke hos dere. NÃ¥r jeg beskriver dere som upofesjonelle er ikke det "stygt", der et korrekt. Jeh aldr noensinne vÃ¦rt i kontakt med mer uprofesjonelle folk enn dere. Til Ã¥ starte med, burder dere kanskje vÃ¦re mer opptatt av Ã¥ levere produktet deres enn Ã¥ be folk om Ã¥ snakke "pÃ¦mt".  Det er mennesker som sitter pÃ¥ andre siden ogsÃ¥ og vi setter ikke pris pÃ¥ Ã¥ bli ignorert.

Uansett, jeg har booket pÃ¥ Skt Petri, sÃ¥ slutt pÃ¥ diskusjonen.

Thank you for the note. Hotels in Miami Beach traditionally run Florida Residents specials to attract locals during low season.

CAA saves you 10% off room only but you pay for parking. Packages on this page have parking included and the room is discounted as well. The Bed & Breakfast package usually works out to be the best deal if you'll be dining each morning and have a vehicle.

Agent:
Since we are currently sold out at the moment the system will not allow me to see if there is a 2 night minimum but it is safe to assume that we will be enforcing it on any given weekend during summer time.

User:
one more question

Agent:
HI sure thing-

User:
I am looking for about 8 nights stay  for 3 peoplein August between 8/6 - 8/18

User:
preferably with breakfast

User:
this is why I was thinking about bedroom suite

Agent:
Is it for 3 adults?

User:
but I do not see it is available...

User:
yes

User:
for 3 adults

Agent:
Starting Aug 13 there is avail for 8 nights.

Agent:
For Aug.13th for eight nights the average rate is $427+taxes per night for the Bedroom Suite with 3 adults.

User:
wow

Agent:
That's about $322+taxes in US currently

User:
anything less expensive which can accommodate 3 peple?

Agent:
Let me take a look for you.

User:
please

Agent:
I have an Erickson Wing Studio with two queen beds available Aug.6 for 4nts or Aug.12 for 5nts. So you still get a balcony you can sit out on and the larger bathroom which is nice.

Agent:
Do you have AAA or would you qualify for a Seniors Rate?

Agent:
Ooh and I have another great option in your preferred dates. We have an Inner Harbour Bedroom Suite that has a king size bed in the bedroom and a double size pull out sofa in the living room. It looks towards downtown Victoria. There isn't a picture on the website of this room unfortunately. There is a patio you can sit out on as well. It is located in our Laurel Wing but has the same larger bathroom as the Erickson Wing. I have that one available for Aug. 7 for 8 nights at an average rate of  $417+taxes per night.

User:
so,there is not water view, correct?

Agent:
Because we have the availability in the Inner Harbour Bedroom Suite for over 7 nights you would qualify for our weekly rate. So this room would be at an average rate of $354+taxes per night. Or about $267+taxes per night at today's US exchange rate.

Agent:
Yes, this one has an inner harbour view and looks towards downtown.

User:
I hope there is no outside nois

User:
noise

Agent:
It actually has a better view than the Bedroom Suites in the Erickson Wing truthfully.

User:
husband is very sensitive

User:
I c

Agent:
No, we are away from the hustle and bustle of downtown.

User:
will breakfast be included in this deal?

User:
or I need to pay extra?

Agent:
We don't have breakfast included in our weekly rate so it would be additional.

User:
how much may I ask?

Agent:
To add on breakfast it would be $21.50+15%gratuity +5% taxes so about $25.96 including grat and tax per adult each day. You would have a choice from 3 entrees in our restaurant plus coffee or tea plus juice. The choices are Point Breakfast (eggs & meat), continental or eggs benny.

My mother is staying at your hotel from tomorrow until Sunday (I believe) and while I am studying in Copenhagen I am unfortunately not here on the weekend. As it is Mothers day on Sunday I wanted to surprise her by delivering some flowers or something else with a little note to the hotel. I could get both tomorrow and bring it over and then it would be amazing if she could receive it on Sunday (perhaps put in the room or at the counter during check out).  Please let me know if this could work :) I am also reachable on phone 91802691. Thanks a lot

User:
I am not seeing how I can book the 124 rate ?

Agent:
Though we do not have our own shuttle, there is a company called YYJ Airporter Shuttle http://www.yyjairportshuttle.com/ which provides service between the airport and the hotels downtown, including ours.  The kiosk is located near the arrivals gate and you do not need reservations for pick-up as they are there whenever flights are departing or arriving. The cost is $25 per person each way, and to compare, the cost of a cab is approximately $60 one way. 

You can also take public transit which is less expensive at $2.50, however it requires a transfer as well as a ten minute walk, which may be uncomfortable depending on how much luggage you have. You would take the #80 from the Airport and connect to the #70 in Sidney, travel into downtown Victoria and then get off  at Douglas at Bellville and walk the rest of the way. The best way to find times is by following directions on BC Transit's website: http://www.busonline.ca/regions/vic/tripplanner.cfm

It is July 10 here--sorry.

I also wanted to make you aware that we now offer transportation to and from the track for $30.00 per person per day. we pick up and drop off once at a predetermined time.

Agent:
$324 is for 2 people in the room. It is high season so the rates are higher.

User:
Hi, I just booked rooms over booking.com. Do you have parking?

Agent:
Hi Janie, No problem at all. 
We do always charge for the first night. As you should have stayed at the hotel for one night, we did charge 1550 DKK,- from the credit card you provided when you booked the room at booking.com

Agent:
35 minutes

Agent:
You're welcome!

Agent:
Good morning. As per hotel's information on booking.com, the hotel does not have parking available.

Agent:
You have to cancel the room the day before arrival before 4pm. Would you like me to sent the invoice to you?

User:
ok thank you

=====
User:
Hello!  Do you provide an iron in studio superior apartment?

Have a great day we hope to see you soon.

Agent:
hi there

Agent:
You can use street parking, however, this is priced at GBP 2.40 per hour between 8:30am and 5:30pm during the week.

Agent:
I am sorry, i did wrote the wrong amount. The first night price was 1350 DKK,- so we did charge 1350 DKK,- 
The next 3 nights is 1550 DKK,- each so in total for the whole stay it should have been 6000 DKK,- Would you like the invoice sent to your email where you can see the amount we charged your credit card for the first night?

=====
User:
do you allow pets? Is there an additional fee?

Agent:
We do not have an iron in all our rooms. On your arrival please ask reception and housekeeping will put one in your room..

User:
Thanks

User:
Ok.  Is there anyway to apply that charge to a new booking instead?

Agent:
yes we do allow pets. our additional fee is $50 per night

Agent:
If you wish further information please feel free to contact us.

Agent:
Is there anything else I can help you with?

Agent:
You have to contact booking.com and ask them, as you booked through them. We hope to see you another time.

Agent:
Our shuttle only goes to and from the airport.

Agent:
The skytrain station is around a 15 min walk away and that will take you straight to Canada place and it will take around 20 minutes to get there

The easiest alternative would be a taxi

User:
how much would taxi cost from your location to Canada place

Agent:
It will be approximately $43 CAD depending on traffic.

User:
which station is the closest and is it a safe walk to the train?

Agent:
The most convenient station is Bridgeport where the River Rock Casino Resort is located and it's relatively safe.

do you by any chance sell train tickets at the hotel?

Skytrain tickets are generally only sold at the stations.

User:
ah ok. that's good to know

User:

they are getting the rooms for 4 nights for 751 euros, but i'm not seeing that rate

Agent:
we are about a 30 min drive from wynwood.

Agent:
Most certainly.

Agent:
The classic double room only has a queen bed which can not be made up as a twin. You will need to reserve a room with a king bed as these are the rooms we can make up as a twin.

Agent:
If you are looking for something slightly more spacious, we would recommend choosing one of our executive rooms or a suite.

Agent:
Oh, this may because you've checked a special rate such as government,etc.

Agent:
You would need to reserve a deluxe king room which has a king bed and sofa bed. The rate on the best available including breakfast and VAT is Â£390.00 and our advance purchase rate is Â£331.50. These rates are per room per night.

Agent:

The reason to why the Unwind price is cheaper, is because it is a discount price for when you book tree or more days.

Agent:
Every hotel in the area is going to have a waiting list - especially for an SEC game. Also, prices are going to be triple the normal price. To be completely honest, I would recommend looking for an Airbnb or VRBO. If you are especially keen on staying in a hotel, I would recommend the Courtyard Marriott which is right across the street from us.

The room type is a Cool Double. The price in US is approx 800,- dollars

Some cruises is really close to the train station, and others are not close to the station and you have to walk for 10 minutes with your luggage. So it depends how close you are from the cruiseship to the station as Oceankey is really long.

Agent:
No you would just need to select the seniors rate, from the top left hand corner.

But lugging luggage to Bridgeport station might be annoying. So perhaps take the shuttle back to the airport and take the train

Just let the bellman know before you leave for your disney cruise that you'll be storing luggage on your return.

I am currently on a weight loss challenge to lose 6 stone. I am taking on physical challenges along my journey, and for each  challenge I take on I raise funds for different charities.

When I reach my target weight-loss I am planning to have a masquerade ball. The reason behind this is I plan to donate all monies brought in from ticket sales and raffle to be split evenly among all the charities that we did challenges for throughout the year. 

I am contacting different hotels in the area to see what you could offer us. We would hope to have about 250 in attendance to include to drinks reception and a meal.
Our preferred date would be any Saturday in December. We will organise to have a band and DJ for the night. 

Can you come back to me with your availability , what price per person it would cost and what you can offer us? 

I look forward to your reply. 

Kind regards 

Shane Farrell

Maestro's 14 Challenge)

Dear Impiana Hotel Ipoh, I am one of your guest which check out on 15 June 2017. My name is Choi Khai Yeat. During my check out, there is problem with your system, thus the reception can't provide me a invoice. They promise to email the invoice to my email account on the same day but I didn't get anything so far

Agent:
Great! That is a manager's special rate. It cannot be booked online, you will need to call us directly at 413-499-3700. Mention this conversation and we'll book that rate for you!

Agent:
Hi, thank you for getting in touch. Kindly send an email to reservation.IHI@impiana.com with the details. Our staff will assist you on this matter.

User:
I'm referring to your website.

Agent:
Thank you.

Agent:
One thing that's important to know is you're seeing an average rate when you look online. Another important thing to check is the room type. The best available rate will always be shown first, which is always for a room in the motel as they are cheaper.

OK. Whats the basic difference between the 2 rooms please

User:
I was booked under a deluxe king room with 3pax under reservation no : 2226746, may i know if this deluxe king room can accommodate for three pax?

Agent:
The Cool is our standard small double rooms and the Brilliant is deluxe rooms

Agent:
Greetings from Impiana KLCC Hotel.  Please do call 03-21471027 or email to reservations.iklcc@impiana.com

Agent:
Size and most Brilliant rooms are facing the courtyard

=====
User:
Not sure it's the best price. Senior rate says it's 30% off best rate and includes complimentary b'fast buffet, but the price is $30 more than best rate. Looks like you're just charging for the "free" b'fast.

User:
are there tea making facilities in all rooms and if we went for the brilliant twin can we request a quiet courtyard room now please ?

Agent:
Hi there, thanks for your message. The 30% off rate (Early Bird Rate, booked at least 14 days in advance) is $196, the same as the Senior's rate. The Senior's rate is better because it does include the complimentary buffet breakfast for 2 (a $50 value). The rate you've noted above ($167.40) is our Early Bird Rate, booked at least 30 days in advance, which is why it's a bit lower. To decide which one is best, it depends on whether you'd want the buffet breakfast included. If you're departing early, or otherwise can't take advantage of the meal, you would be better off booking the Early Bird, 30 days rate of $167.40.

Agent:
Yes tea and coffee facilities in all rooms - and yes we can offer courtyard facing Briliant twin - do you wish to go ahead and book?

=====

and in the other one 2 adults+1 kid and the baby which is only 1 year old and do not need specific space

Agent:
I'm very grad to hear from you, kindly advise me by return e-mail pleased

User:
is this option of 2 superior garden rooms would be ok for all of us then?

User:
is this what you mean?

Agent:
Yes, 2 rooms of Superior Garden at THB 4,400net per room per night is all right for your party. How old for child in 1st room?

Agent:
For 2nd room child 1 years we can arrange baby cot by complimentary.

Agent:
if child 4 years above sharing bed with parent is free of charge, Breakfast will be charge at THB 250net per child per meals

User:
room 1: 2 adults + 1 kid (9 yeras old)

User:
room 2: 2 adults + 1 kid (5 years old) + 1 baby (1 year old)

User:
would you be so kind to include transfer from and also TO the airport at this rate?

Agent:
I'm afraid if 2 + 2 child can not fit in Superior because it is maximum stay only 2 + 1 child below 12 years.

Agent:
Then, I would like to recommend Deluxe Garden at THB 5,600net per room per night

User:
can we make an exception, no baby cot and we go on this way? I mean room the baby and kid (5 yeras old) share with us the bed

Agent:
It would be all right for special case for you. However, there is no bay cot set up as you said all both your child sharing bed with you. Breakfast will be charge at THB 250net for child for this room. For infant 1 years is complimentary.

Dear Prof.Humayun,

Thanks for your reply. All the speakers will be provided 3 nights accommodation as stated in the invitation letter. I have been informed that you are also involved in the closed meeting on the 16th July, so that is why I reserved the room starting from 15th till 18th July. As the payment has been made to the hotel, I will inform the hotel for the date changes but the total of nights paid is still the same. I will inform the hotel that you will stay for one more night (check out on 20th july) and will.pay directly to the hotel.

Dear Prof.Humayun,

Thanks for your reply. All the speakers will be provided 3 nights accommodation as stated in the invitation letter. I have been informed that you are also involved in the closed meeting on the 16th July, so that is why I reserved the room starting from 15th till 18th July. As the payment has been made to the hotel, I will inform the hotel for the date changes but the total of nights paid is still the same. I will inform the hotel that you will stay for one more night (check out on 20th july) and will.pay directly to the hotel.

Sarina

Dear Dr.Sarina Sulong
Thank you very much for your email. I am honoured to be a presenter in your conference. My wife and I will reach KL on 16th and will stay till 20th. Before receiving your email, I had already booked a room in Impiana for my wife and myself for these dates. As I understand that you have booked the room for 3 nights from 15th-19th, kindly change that to 16th-20th. I will pay for the fourth night myself. I am looking forward to attending the conference.

Dear Sir or Madam,
 
today i booked a room from September 20th to September 21st in your hotel.
Now i have a few questions.

I have read that you offer a free shuttle service.
Is this only from the hotel to the airport, or also from the airport (when we arrive) to the hotel?
If so, where do we find this shuttleservice at the airport and at what times does this? Do we have to register?
Our plane lands on 20.9. at 10.55am, until we have our luggage and get out, it will be about 11.30am.
 
Is it possible to get a room on the top floor, with great views of the harbor?
 
Is on 20.9. Evening the Richmond Night market?
 
We have to pick up our camper on 21.9.
The address is: Cruise Canada RV Rental & Sales, 7731 Vantage Way, Delta, BC V4G 1A6, Canada.
Can you tell me which connection to the public transport is available, or how much is a taxi from your hotel to the rental station?
 
I am looking forward to your reply,
and many greets from Germany,
Coinna Gruber

Hi,

I stayed in the hotel from the 17th to 19th April, and bought a ticket for the Tivoli from reception on the 17th, at 17.10. I was in Copenhagen on a business trip, so I asked the receptionist to charge my ticket to my personal debit card, and he did so, and money was taken from my personal card. However, the same amount of money was taken out of my work credit card at the end of my stay when I paid for the room. 

Therefore, I paid for 2 tickets to the Tivoli, one on my personal bank account and one with my work bank account, and was only given one ticket.

I would like a refund for one ticket please.

Thank you,

hello from Lisbon

Agent:
Thank you for your question. Beacon Hotel South Beach is located right on the famous Ocean Drive where parking can be difficult. We offer 24-hour valet parking for $25/night with unlimited in-and-out service. There are also a couple of options for self-parking: public parking garages can be located just two blocks away on Collins Ave and 7th street. There's also meter parking available along Ocean Drive, Collins, and Washington Avenue, but spots are in high demand. Mostly, you will find it's more convenient to valet your car, especially if you stay in South Beach during weekend. Should you have any other questions please do not hesitate to contact us.

Agent:
Hello, thank you for reaching us. The maximum occupancy of our rooms are only for 2 adults

Ann Sterman - We are leaving on the 16th, so that won't work.  We have stayed there in the past and loved it.  Any suggestions for this very last minute trip?

User:
is a rental car necessary where you are located?

Agent:
Thank you so much for your feedback Ms. Sterman! I am happy to place the booking on the waitlist if you'd like should anything become available we would be reaching out. If you are looking for a property close in proximity to the Loden the closest hotels would be the Hyatt Regency and Coast Coal Harbour

Agent:
The hotel is located in the heart of South Beach. Everything is centrally located and within walking distance of the hotel

User:
We're looking for a small beautiful hotel like your (as close as it can be like yours)

Agent:
While everything is nearby, should you want to explore outside of the city, we can assist in renting cars as well.

Agent:
Certainly. In terms of boutique style properties I believe the Wedgewood is located in the area, though not the same feel as the Loden it would be similar in terms of size boutique feel.

User:
If I book now do I pay now or upon arrival?

User:
they do not have availability

Agent:
ONly the first night deposit is required to guarantee the booking. Remaining balance is due at arrival

Agent:
I am sorry to hear that Ms. Sterman, this is a very busy time in the city. My suggestion would therefore be to try looking on Tripadvisor or Expedia which properties would have availability for these dates.

User:
We have one reserved but I was thinking if letting it go since your hotel is in the heart of Miami.  I would like to go to bal harbor mall and boca raton. I'm not sure how much an uber is to those places from your location.

Agent:
I understand. While Bal Harbor is nearby, Boca Raton is quite a distance from the hotel. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.

Hi Tammy, thank you.

User:
Well in the meantime the baby is still a baby, but uses now a small bed

Would you like to provide me with your phone number or email? I can have the Concierge get in touch with you.

User:
Hello - Does your hotel provide roll away beds?

User:
No, I mean the double bed... To see whether he could fit with us

Agent:
We do provide them, we have a very limited supply, and it is on a first come first serve basis. We highly recommend that you provide your own airmatress or fold away if it is possible for you to do so, especially on busy event dates.

Agent:
We usually not allow children over the age of two to sleep with the parents in the same bed as our beds are Queensize.

User:
Thank you!

User:
Ok then, we'll use the cot I guess

Agent:
Yep!

Hello happy summer. My husband and I run a youth camp in rural Alaska that takes the wind out of our sails by the end of the summer. I am a nursing teacher and my husband a hard working  remote worker for teaching and helping water plant workers  keep 15 villages of rural Alaska  water and sewer working.

User:
Today is our 25th wedding anniversary and unfortunately due to commitments we are unable to go anywhere.  However on this our anniversary we are planning a special trip the beginning of August.  I see you have various packages and wonder if you could let me know how this would work to get a few of them during a stay with you.

Agent:
Good Afternoon, which dates and packages are you interested in?

User:
Well thank you for responding. dates are  Wednesday August 9th through August 13

User:
Did I mention we went to Victoria for our honeymoon?  :-)

User:
Looking at spicing up marriage so the naughty package and then the butchart garden. I wondered with the butchart gardens about transportation to gardens?

Agent:
We can definitely arrange both of these packages for you - Currently we do have very limited availability over your dates. Let me just take a look and see what we can do for you

Agent:
Transportation out to the gardens is not included in the package, you would need to take the local bus, a taxi or you can book a shuttle service through CVS tours.

User:
Great thanks. Even if it is a couple of those  dates at front or end of our stay we can always  do other accomodations

User:
ok thank you for the info on the gardens

User:
we do have alternative dates possible of August 7 &8th

Agent:
We can accommodate you for the full duration in one of our Erickson Wing Studio rooms with 1 king bed. With the Butchart Gardens package the nightly rate would be $428.30 on average, plus taxes and fees. This would include breakfast each day, your entry to the gardens and complimentary parking (if needed).

Agent:
To add on the naughty package, it would be an additional $125 plus taxes

Agent:
The quoted rates are in Canadian Dollars

User:
Oh that makes some sense what is the cost in US? and I do not see the Erickson Wing Studio on your website?

Agent:
http://laurelpoint.com/studios/

Agent:
Approximate nightly rate is $322.64 USD, and the naughty package would be about $94 USD

User:
Great thanks

User:
Ok let think on this a few min. will be back in a few minutes.

Agent:
You're welcome!

User:
Is this with taxes included?

Agent:
The rates quoted are not including tax

User:
ok  is there any better rate I don't mean to be miserly but I see the same room on a hotel discount site of 287 US . If I get that room can I add the romance part?

User:
How much are taxes?

User:
Do you have the naughty romance package available Monday August 7th?

Agent:
I believe the rate you are viewing would be just the room, not including the Butchart Gardens package, which I have included in the quote and then also quoted you to add on the extras from the naughty package. We can certainly book in just the room, and then add on the package however this would only give you breakfast for one day, if you wanted breakfast daily we would need to look at package pricing.

Agent:
Rates also do fluctuate daily so depending on which days you are looking at, the rates could be different.

Agent:
Taxes are 17.16%

User:
yes I am realizing this is a real industry now just getting a hotel :-) I miss the days of just making the reservation. :-)

Agent:
You can always make a reservation and change it later depending on availability. We just need 24 hours notice prior to check in for cancellations.

User:
Good to know. WE are actually there for a week so I am trying to figure a plan out. will have some dates shortly.  Can I make reservations through the website or shall I call?

Agent:
Either or is fine, we can be reached toll-free at 1.800.663.7667

User:
Ok great thank you so much for your help!

Agent:
You are most welcome!

=====
User:
I see there is a spa option and wonder if there are any couples massage?

Agent:
We have Inn Room Spa Services but would require a date and time which you would like the massages to take place on in order to inquire with our mobile spa company if they are available.

Agent:
They do offer couples massages, however not all rooms can accommodate both massage tables.

User:
Great thanks that helps.

=====
User:
Ya! So What rooms are available for Monday August 7 and 8th for one day naughty romance and  instead of the Buchart gardens how does the 150 food tour work? Is that a package or separate?

Agent:
Hi we have Laurel Wing Guest Rooms available and Erickson Wing Studios for the nights of 7th & 8th August.  The 150 food tour gets 20% discount when booked with the 150 Package.  The Package includes a Canadian Welcome amenity from the Pastry Chef, Ketchup Chips, 650ml bottle Driftwood Fat Tug Beer and breakfast for 2 in Aura from a choice of Entres and Complimentary Parking.

=====
User:
Thank you for expanding and sticking with my million questions.  Just a few  more questions . If you were on a slight budget and desired a King bed and nice view  which room would you pick?  How much is the Nughty  Romance  package?

Agent:
Hi the Erickson Wing Studios are certainly more luxurious and larger to celebrate a special occassion.  They have a large 4 piece Marble bathroom and a larger outside balcony with Patio furniture.  The Laurel Wing guest rooms are comfortable with a combination bath and shower and a small standing room balcony.  The rate for Naughty Package for the Erickson Wing at that time is $1073.99 which includes the Naughty Kit and Sparkling wine and chocolate desert 1 night and breakfast and parking for the both nights and a 2pm checkout.  The Laurel wing guest room is $839.67 for the same package.

User:
Could a double massage be done in teh Laurel wing guest room?

Agent:
Yes in a Laurel Wing Guest Room with a king Bed

User:
Wonderful  does the lower priced room also have a standing balcony ?

User:
If so Im sold!

Agent:
Yes it has a standing Room Balcony

User:
Great!

User:
Shall I call to make reservation  or what is best so  it is connected to our conversations?

Obviously I will clean up after him if he makes a mess, but I'm quite certain that it wont be a problem as he is such a good boy. Thanks in advance!

You can't book directly with me with air miles, I believe you have to book it on the air miles website. There would be no view of the water. The view would be of roof tops and other buildings.

Agent:
What was the clients name I can note an early check in request for them

Agent:
What time do you land?

Agent:
Of course :)

User:
darn!  we have stayed here before and had a beautiful view and fabulous stay

User:
Hi, I'm checking in tomorrow and I was wondering what facilities for parking are available?

Agent:
right now we are not anticipating we will sell out the night before, so if you want to stop at the hotel first when you land we can see if we have a room available for early check in at that time- it would be just the $30 fee if so

User:
Availabilty for 2 rooms for Tuesday night for my colleagues

Agent:
Hello,  our closest car park is Park Rite, Fleet street.  Our guests can get a discount on this car park, you will just need to ask at reception for the discount ticket as you are departing.

Agent:
If you wanted to 100% guarantee a room that early you'd need to pay for the night before, so we do not sell the room to another guest on Wednesday night

User:
Wednesday also

User:
Ok great, does this car park require pre booking?

Agent:
But I think you'll be okay without doing that

Agent:
We still have the 24 hour sale going on, the same rate you have is available for them also - a Deluxe King room would be $202.30 CDN per night, before tax

Agent:
No, there is no need to pre book a space.

Agent:
Otherwise stop by the hotel and drop off your luggage, park a car if needed and head out on the town!

Agent:

Unfortunately the Butchart Gardens package does not include transportation. If you do not have a vehicle, you would be better off reserving the room separately.

They run every hour in the summer from 9am-5pm. Their information can be found here: http://www.cvstours.com/sightseeing-tours/

Hi there,

User:
I'd like ask one thing about check-out time

User:
we want to check in August 10th

User:
is late check-out available at that day?

User:
If so, how much we should pay more and how long we can stay?

Agent:
What time are you requesting to check out at?

User:
hopefully 3pm

Agent:
We offer complimentary check- out until 1pm but a 3pm checkout would be a $30.00 plus tax charge

User:
is it always available ?

User:
we will use expedia for reservation

User:
is it okay to let the receptionist know when we are check - in?

Agent:
Our late check-out availability is dependent upon our occupancy levels.

Agent:
If you book a reservation on expedia, the system should automatically sync with our system. If you want to make sure we have your reservation in our system, please do not hesitate to contact us 24 hours after making your expedia booking.

Agent:
If you are inquiring about late check-out, you can request it during check-in with the front desk agent.

User:
so that means there is a possibility that you might not be able to offer late check-out?

Agent:
Unfortunately, that is true.

User:
Is there any way for us to have late check-out for sure?

User:
we can make a reservation and pay now

Agent:
Is 3pm the latest you are requesting to check-out?

User:
yes

Agent:
If 3pm is definite, there should not be a problem to guarantee a late check out

User:
so we can just tell the front when we check-in?

Agent:
That is correct.

If you are flying into Miami International Airport, the easiest way to get to the hotel is to take a taxi. This is a flat fee of $35.

There is no need to make advance reservations, just from the departures gate, there will be a queue of taxis outside. 
 
All taxies that operate out of the airport are safe and fully bonded.

Please let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with.

Agent:
Thank you Mr Brown! May I also have your home address?

Agent:
I'm sorry to inform you but our Bedford Double are all sold out from Aug 5th or Aug 13th. Is there any other dates we can accommodate? I can suggest booking two separate rooms if you like. The average nightly rate for the Grove Queen for that length stay is $290 USD but I could offer a 10% discount on the rate which comes out to $261.50 USD average per night. Because you are staying 3 night and longer, there is a 15% promotion rate discount which makes it $246.13 USD. If booked under this promotion, a full deposit of the stay has to be made and it is non-refundable. If you have any further questions, you can always call us directly for an immediate answer. Thank you.

If you are arriving domestic, go down one level from baggage claims and go out the doors to your left. If you are arriving on the international side, exit out the international arrival doors and proceed to the green awning.

User:
jost218@hotmail - thank you

Agent:
Thank you. The rate on June 24, 2017 for a deluxe room with two queen beds is $185 CAD plus taxes and if you like to upgrade to our two bedroom suite, it's an upgrade charge of $250 CAD plus taxes. Therefore, the total price with the upgrade is $435 CAD plus taxes. For the return stay it's the same price.

Agent:
Good Morning.

=====
User:
you too

User:
sorry - email is  jost218@hotmail.com

User:
Just so I am clear, and the reason for my checking. The PROMO Rate for WRESORTS is showing 155 for a deluxe King. It seems it would be a better price to just get two rooms instead of a two room suite.

Agent:
Which month?

=====
User:
How close are you to the cruise port?

User:
Do you have dates from the 9th - 16th September available for the three bedroomed villa? Any dates in September would actually be ok - thanks

Agent:
That is correct. The $155 rate is based on double occupancy but you mentioned there will be a 3rd adult in the room that is why the rate is $185

Agent:
July 22nd?

User:
also, is it possible to take a train from the airport to t he hotel?

Agent:
Hello

Agent:
Yes, you are also correct. The best value would be getting two rooms vs. a two bedroom suite.

User:
This month

Agent:
Hello sorry for the delay.

Agent:
Yes we do have Three Bedroom Villa available on 09th until 16th September 2017.

=====
User:
Thanks

Agent:
The day use rooms are not available this saturday

Agent:
From the airport you can take the train towards the central station which takes 15 minutes. From there you can walk to us within 3 minutes.

User:
Thank you for that - could you tell me the price please? Also my sister-in-law and family have been to you several times and loved it and recommend a villa close to the Prana and across the road from Le Spot Deli. Would you require a deposit or full payment?

Agent:
My pleasure.

User:
Ok thank you

Agent:
The cruise terminal is a 15 minute taxi ride away from the hotel. You can also take a bus, but you would have to walk about 500 meters from where the bus drops you off.

User:
Just remembered you had given me a price !! Sorry! I'm presuming it's $3097.50?

Are you interested in booking with me today? I can call you if you  like.

Agent:
Hi

Agent:
It's likely that's the pre-authorization, rather than a finalized charge. Generally, all hotels will pre-authorize a certain amount for any potential incidentals which may be incurred during your stay. Any portion not spent toward incidentals (dining, movies, etc.) is released upon checkout. Normally, it should appear back on your statement within about 5-7 business days, depending on your card and issuing bank.

Agent:
We have A/C in all our rooms :)

Which room type?

so all the other conditions are the same?

From Waterfront station the taxi ride to the Loden would take roughly 10 minutes.

Agent:
Our signature room is actually one of my favorite rooms as they have a nice sliding wall to the bathroom which opens up the space quite a bit. Although if you are looking for a view our Park Vista or Garden Terrace rooms would be a great option!

User:
(I normally don't spell this poorly - the screen keeps hopping around.)

User:
Excellent thank you

Agent:
Hello there,

Agent:
you are welcome...

Agent:
The Park Vista is a corner room offering a partial view of the water. This room is $60 more than the signature, so approximately $420 USD on the 21st. And then the Garden Terrace actually has a little step out patio that overlooks our urban oasis on the 2nd floor. It's a unique little green space with a running stream right outside your room. Very peaceful! The Garden Terrace rooms also include extra little amenities such as complimentary sauna sessions and yogi tea. These rooms are $100 more than the signature.

Agent:
I will gladly check if it is possible, may I have your last name that the booking is made in?

User:
Could you please tell me if your rates for the rooms are in $USD or $AUD ??

User:
Park Vista is $420 USD on the 21st and the Signature King is $418? I know you mentioned it's $60 more, was that for the 23rd instead or does that take out the included breakfast ? Just to clarify- sorry

User:
Joseph Howley

User:
The reason I ask is we have been invoiced for $2100.00 and was advertised as $1500.00 on your site!

Agent:
My apologies, the Park Vista on the 21st would be $460 USD.

Agent:
Thank you

User:
Thanks

Agent:
I was looking at the rate on the 23rd. Sorry for the confusion.

Agent:
give me one moment please

Agent:
All the rate confirmed is on $USD....

User:
Also I read about possible drop-off car services and bike services, would this be included in the hotel stay fee or is it an extra fee? Would the bikes be able to used for a couple of hours around Stanley park/Seawall?

User:
We just booked the trip 2 nigh ago - 8/28 - 31. It may nt show up yet?

User:
No problem. Thank you

Agent:
Yes, these are both included for all hotel guests complimentary.

Agent:
I have found you in the system, if you were to buy an upgrade to a Junior suite it would cost 800,- DKK extra per night.

Hi There

User:
Excellent.  Will you include room or room # in email?

Agent:
Though we do not have our own shuttle, there is a company called YYJ Airporter Shuttle http://www.yyjairportshuttle.com/ which provides service between the airport and the hotels downtown, including ours.  The kiosk is located near the arrivals gate and you do not need reservations for pick-up as they are there whenever flights are departing or arriving. The cost is $25 per person each way, and to compare, the cost of a cab is approximately $60 one way. 

You can also take public transit which is less expensive at $2.50, however it requires a transfer as well as a ten minute walk, which may be uncomfortable depending on how much luggage you have. You would take the #80 from the Airport and connect to the #70 in Sidney, travel into downtown Victoria and then get off  at Douglas at Bellville and walk the rest of the way. The best way to find times is by following directions on BC Transit's website: http://www.busonline.ca/regions/vic/tripplanner.cfm

Agent:
Room number will be assigned on the 14th based on availability

User:
Thank you very much, that's very helpful

User:
This was a junior suite in the Laurel Wing at the AAA rate. Does that mean within 24 hours of the arrival date?

Agent:
That's correct, so up until 4pm the day prior to arrival you are able to cancel at no charge

User:
Would the  summer deal offer lower rates?

User:
And is there any way to get from your hotel to downtown other than by walking?

User:
Are you still there?

Agent:
Sorry, was just taking a look at our rates for that time

User:
no problem

Agent:
Looks like the AAA discount would be the best available rate at $264 CAD/night + taxes. The Bed & Breakfast package is available at $312 CAD/night + taxes, this includes breakfast for two and parking

Agent:
In regards to getting downtown, our front desk staff can organise a taxi for you, and it would be $5-10 depending on where you needed to go

User:
The rate I'd seen online a few minutes ago was something like $206/night--less than for a smaller guestroom, so I'd assumed it would be a special on the junior suite.

User:
That may have been $206 USD

Agent:
Yes, $206 USD comes to approximately $264 CAD

User:
Are there any special offers in the Erickson Wing for those dates? It's just for me, and I qualify for both AAA and AARP rates, but I like a roomy room. And can one request a NO-pet room?

Agent:
We do have the Erickson Wing Studios with a king bed available. They are about 450 square feet in size, and the AAA/AARP discount is $354 CAD/night + tax, which is about $275 USD/night

Agent:
And you are able to request a no-pet room

User:
Thanks. I'll probably book the junior suite in the Laurel Wing then and request a no-pet room. Do all the rooms have good water views?

Agent:
The Junior Suites have a partial water view. If you were wanting a room with a good view in the Laurel Wing, I would suggest the Inner Harbour guest rooms ($291 CAD/night) or the Sunset rooms ($300 CAD/night)

User:
Okay. Thanks for all the info.

You're very welcome! Let me know if you have any questions

I was asked to prepare a travel article about Belgrad for the May issue of magazine Glober (which is served by Atlas Global Airline Company in airplanes) since Atlas Global has started to fly from Istanbul to Belgrad as of April 12th. Ä°n order to prepare the article and take photos, I will be in Belgrad from April 17th-19th. I would like to ask for free of charge accommodation for 2 nights in your hotel and in return offer to write a detailed text about your hotel l in my 6 pager article. I want to thank you in advance for your cooperation. I would need your feedback as soon as possible to fix my travel plans. Ä°f you would like to have more information about me and my previous works, you can either visit my web page www.omerkokal.com or search my name at Google.
Thank you very much for your consideration,

User:
For 7 adults and 1 infant

Agent:
It's likely that's the pre-authorization, rather than a finalized charge. Generally, all hotels will pre-authorize
a certain amount for any potential incidentals which may be incurred during your stay. Any portion not spent toward incidentals (dining, movies, etc.) is released upon checkout. Normally, it should appear back on your statement within about 5-7 business days, depending on your card and issuing bank.

Hi there, I can take a look for you. Do you have your confirmation number?

Agent:
There isn't a shuttle that comes directly to the hotel, but there are a few different options on how to get here from the ferry.
1. BC Ferries Connector - There are multiple locations which you can get on to the bus, the price will vary depending on which location you choose to board. Please follow this link to find pricing and schedule information: http://bcfconnector.com/travel-information/
2. Public Transit - Busses leave with the ferry arrivals times and drop passengers downtown (about 10 minutes away, by foot). This is the most economical option at $2.50 per person, and a schedule is found here: http://www.busonline.ca/regions/vic/schedules/schedule.cfm?line=70
3. Taxi - They recommend making a reservation, and the company we recommend is called Blue Bird Cabs. The taxi would cost approximately $55 and their website is here: http://www.taxicab.com/

Agent:
That would be the wonderfull or the junior suite.

My Instagram profile @mindz.eye has a following of over 149,000 followers with very high engagement. Having recently worked with marquee brands such as Sony and Lincoln Motor Co, I wanted to reach out to see if you'd be interested in doing a social media collaboration. I'll be in New York City from May 19-23rd, 2017 and in exchange for accommodations, I could offer you promotional features on my platform.  In addition, I could offer some photography services to your hotel if you'd be interested. Please let me know at your earliest convenience if you'd like to discuss my proposal further.

Our room prices vary depending on the day of the week. Do you know what time of the week you are looking for?

Agent:
Our shuttle bus is complimentary and runs 24 hours a day. No need to call ahead to book as it is on an automatic schedule.  From the airport, the shuttle leaves every 20 minutes starting from the 10 after (x:10, x:30, x:50, etc). If you are arriving domestic, go down one level from baggage claims and go out the doors to your left. If you are arriving on the international side, exit out the international arrival doors and proceed to the green awning.

Your rates seem to have gone up pretty significantly vs. the prior year. My wife & I have stayed at your property every year for the last dozen years. Is there a reason for the steep price increase?

Rates are based on season and availability, so perhaps the last time you stayed with us we were offering a discounted rate. Do you have a first and last name so I can look up your previous reservations?

Good Morning. It looks like when you booked last year it was only a couple days before your arrival. Sometimes if we have a lot of open availability close to the arrival date the rates do drop. You also booked with the promotional rate that if you stay 3 nights you save 15%.

Very good. We'll see you on 8-28.  I hope the little bar opposite the dining area wasn't replaced but I guess it may have been with the new restaurant set to open?  If so I'm going to miss my popcorn.

Unfortunately due to our availability that Luxury King Suite is the only room I could wave the two night minimum for. If you need multiple rooms other then the one I offered, the two night minimum is still in effect. So it would have to be a Friday-Saturday night stay or a Saturday-Sunday night stay.

Ok great, if you were wanting to book the package which includes accommodation and ferry, you would need to reserve through the ferry company

User:
ok thanks

User:
thank you very much

Agent:
What did the bad review say? Our concept 24 is an option for late check-outs when making direct reservations with us. It basically means you can request a late check-out as late as you checked in. So if you check-in at 4pm you can request a late check-out for 4pm -free of charge.

Agent:
You're welcome! Let me know if you have any other questions

Agent:
I'm afraid we are sold out completely on Friday, and have a couple rooms left for Saturday

User:
Here was one review and I realize you have since added A/C to every room: Hotel is open air extremely warm in July afternoons. Erotic shops and strip clubs are on each and every street to the hotel. Hookers congrats on the corner being loud until they were chased off by a local resident.

User:
look forward to your confirmation

Agent:
We have two sister properties in the area if you'd like me to check those? The Majestic Hotel and the City Suites

Agent:
Yes, correct we just finished a thorough renovation of the entire hotel. There are erotic shops and strip clubs in the area, unfortunately some hookers too although harmless. But there are not any issues regarding safety as long as you take care of yourself, like any other big city.

Agent:
Great, it will come through in the next hour or so

Hello..

User:
Hi,

I stayed with your hotel between 15th to 17th April 2017. My confirmation number is 16728644. While I checked-in I specifically asked your front desk manager who helped me with the checkin if there is free parking available for guests inside the hotel and he replied yes and asked me to park in the space in the front of the hotel and he took down my car registration number but while I checked out there was different person in the front desk and that lady told me that I will be charged for the parking for two days at CAD20 per day, I told her that I was not told about this CAD 20 per day charge and that I should not be charged. When I got back to the USA and checked my credit card bill, I was charged USD 28.40 which is not fair. 

This is a  small amount but there should be fair practice, probably your front desk manager forgot to tell me about the CAD 20 charge per day. As a customer I feel that I am being conned. I suggest that you refund this amount, so that it is straight and fair. If you choose not to refund, I will not be staying in your property again, losing one customer might not be a big deal for you but itâs important to be fair to your customers.

Agent:
Hi there, many thanks for your chat.
Can you please advise on which date you wish to arrive ?

Agent:
Hi, we don't accept groups at this hotel sorry.

Agent:
Hi, yes we have available rooms for all three nights.

My daughter will be in transit through Vancouver from about 8am till 6:30 pm on September 24th.  She's going from Brisbane, Australia to London, via Vancouver.

Do you have this service?  If so, what would be the charge for 6 or 6.5 hours on September 24th?

Hello, I'm extremely flexible with my travel dates; when is the cheapest time of the year to book the Jacuzzi Suite?  I'm  assuming it'll be mid-week.  Many thanks.

Agent:
Thank you for your inquiry & have a good day ahead.

Agent:
As our rates fluctuate on a daily basis, it is quite difficult to say, however, our low season is November - March.

Agent:
How many nights for would you be looking to stay with us?

User:
It will be two nights, a brief trip.

Agent:
Could you be a little more specific regarding the month you would prefer?

User:
That's the thing, we can travel anytime so we're willing to work around your cheapest months.  I see from checking availability on the website that it's Â£533 for two nights mid week in September (romance package) for example.  That's the cheapest I've seen it

Agent:
Very interesting! I am looking at the month of September and the lowest price for a Jacuzzi Suite I can see is Â£391 per night and that would not include the Romance Package. The cheapest option I am able to locate would be weekdays in January available at Â£289 per night for our Flexible Best Available Rate.

User:
Maybe I was looking at the wrong results!  The information you've provided is very useful, thank you very much!  I'll get in touch when we decide to make a booking.

Agent:
My pleasure! Booking direct with ourselves will also entitle you to a Half Bottle of Fizzante, so please do not hesitate to contact us via email on reservations@niracaledonia.com or telephone on +44 131 225 2720.

User:
That's wonderful!  Out of interest, what is the difference between your jacuzzi suites?  I see on the website that each is slightly different.  Does one have a better view, larger TV etc...?  I can't find many photos of the room on the website, just angles of the jacuzzi

User:
Also, one of the photos shows a huge number of candles around the bath (I love it)!  Would we actually have all of those candles?

Agent:
All of our rooms are different in regards to their design etc., however, they all feature same amenities. We do not guarantee specific rooms to be available in case of unforeseen circumstances such as maintenance issues etc.

Agent:
The candles in question would be a part of our Romantic Turndown which is priced at additional Â£20.

User:
To clarify are these jacuzzi baths or actual hot tubs that are always filled and hot and ready to jump in to?

=====

We stayed with you last winter and I think rate including parking for 14 days was much cheaper.  Is $259 for 20 days parking the best you can do?

April 17.  Park until evening of May 6.

Agent:
A park stay go rate is available at $259 + tax, deluxe room with one queen bed or 2 double beds. Includes a maximum of 22 days of self parking.

User:
That's the best you can do?

To the staff at the Time New York hotel, 
Myself and a best friend are traveling to NYC to celebrate her 30th birthday, It will also be a reunion as she is traveling from New Zealand and myself from living in London for the past 2 years.
 I was hoping, if it was at all possible that there was something special you could do for our stay with you and or our time in NYC. We would both really appreciate it and I'm sure she would be surprised as she doesn't know about any of this. Our reservation with you Is 1993.363.620 checking in on 04.05.17 and checking out 08.05.17
Anything would be amazing but if not I'm sure we will both have a lovely stay with you and enjoy the celebrations. 
Thank you 
Hannah Vaughan

You can also take public transit which is less expensive at $2.50, however it requires a transfer as well as a ten minute walk, which may be uncomfortable depending on how much luggage you have. You would take the #80 from the Airport and connect to the #70 in Sidney, travel into downtown Victoria and then get off  at Douglas at Bellville and walk the rest of the way. The best way to find times is by following directions on BC Transit's website: http://www.busonline.ca/regions/vic/tripplanner.cfm

I'm not sure. It's hard to say because it depends on the number of rooms that are sold. The closer to being sold out the government rate becomes closed out. You can always book it and then cancel it before the cancellation policy (24 hours prior to arrival, before 4pm to modify/cancel reservation)

It's reasonable that you have to do construction, but a heads-up at check-in that it would be starting right outside the room at 8:00 am would have been good at check-in. If there were any empty rooms available, one not immediately beside the construction would have been even better. Other than that, it's been a good stay!

Confirmation No. 46844918
Room No. 1410

Hi!

I stayed in your hotel from June 15 until June 23, 2017. Upon check-in a deposit of US$100 was temporarily taken out from my Citibank credit card. I did not incur any expense or charges during my stay in your hotel. It has been eight (8) days since I checked out, and the $100 hasn't been returned or remitted back to my Citibank credit card account. This is very unfair to hold on to my funds, as I never incurred any charges during our stay.

Please return the US$100 to my account immediately.

Thank you.

Ms. Weena Tan

Good morning, 

I am interested in hosting my firmâs holiday party in one of your event spaces. We would also require some meeting space prior to the party for a smaller group of our Executives.  Could you kindly send me a copy of your catering menu as well as the specs for your event space? The party would be for 50 people while the meeting space would only need to hold 15. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Warm regards,

Hi Pat, thank you for your message. I apologize for the confusion; hopefully I can help. We've just recently changed our policies regarding advance purchase bookings, to make them more flexible. Used to be, once the booking was made, payment was taken immediately, and there would be no changes or cancellations permitted. As you've made your reservation after the change, it's better for you. We do still take payment right away, but you are permitted to cancel your booking, up until 24 hours before your arrival date. If you do need to cancel, the deposit is refunded to you, with no additional penalty. Again, I do apologize that we weren't clear. Please feel free to contact us at any time if you have any other questions or concerns.

Thank you. May I please have the exoiration date?

Thank you for your question. Beacon Hotel South Beach is located right on the famous Ocean Drive where parking can be difficult.

There are also a couple of options for self-parking: public parking garages can be located just two blocks away on Collins Ave and 7th street. There's also meter parking available along Ocean Drive, Collins, and Washington Avenue, but spots are in high demand. Mostly, you will find it's more convenient to valet your car, especially if you stay in South Beach during weekend. Please let me know if you have further questions

Is there a One bedroom available from 8 to 10 or only the 2 bedrooms?

User:

If so, what are the rates?  We would be departing May 20, returning to Vancouver on June 9.

You can inquire from the Ground Transportation Desk.  From Port Authority, you may either walk north on 8th Avenue and make a right on 49th Street.  You may also opt to take a cab from Port Authority.  Hope this helps.

The outer harbour view faces away from downtown and is more of an open water view and here you can see the seaplanes land

If you do have a preferred view type, we can request it on your reservation for you. Or if there is a particular view on the website you like, do let me know and I can let you know if it is inner or outer harbour

They can be twin beds room ?

User:
Can you please check if that is still available for 28 May-31 May ?

Agent:

We can offer a Brilliant deluxe for 3 nights at DKK 4040 (twin bedding) including breakfast buffet and vat and the Wonderful at DKK 4520 for 3 nights

User:
Thanks, brilliant twin beds room is bigger than double bed ?

Agent:
Sorry  no - the twin bedding is 2 single beds (90x200)

User:
Sorry I meant the room size for twin beds and double bed in Brilliant.

Agent:
Brilliant twin or double bed are within the same size

User:
I see. Because you mentioned room size app 16-19m. So I thought maybe the room size is different between twin beds and double one.

User:
Is that possible for you to offer a price lower than DKK4520 for wonderful twin beds room ?

Agent:
sorry - the 4520 DKK is our best offer - 20% discount when booking min 3 nights. Refundable rate.

User:
:(     thanks...

User:
Then I will need to talk with my friend.

User:
Do you have kettle in the room ?

Yes in the Brilliant and  Wonderful rooms there is a Nespresso for coffee and tea

User:
Thanks a lot for your kindly help!

User:
Sorry for asking so many questions.

Agent:
No problem - my pleasure. Happy to help

User:
If I'd like to book the room, I should book through website or email ?

You can book through both and the offer is refundable - hence you can cancel free of charge until 4pm the day before arrival.
