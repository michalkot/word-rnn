Hi there, thanks for your question. Yes, you can do it that way; there's a difference though. When you park before your stay, you need to visit the front desk to register your license plate number, and you would also need to pay for the booking in full at that time. It becomes non-cancellable as well once you've parked the vehicle, as you're using part of the package (parking portion)

No, also is booked. However, executive suites are booked tentatively, so maybe they will become available since we don't have 100% guaranteed booking

User:
It's our anniversary this day.

User:
24 yrs, on the 24th, the Golden one

Agent:
Oh congratulations!

Agent:
I'm just taking a look at our website to check the pricing

Agent:
I do see we are selling our Garden Studios at $384 CAD + taxes, but the One Bedroom Suites are at $444 CAD + taxes

Agent:
The One Bedroom Suite has a king bed in the bedroom, and a separate living room. The Studio has the king bed and sitting area all in the one room

User:
Oh, I specifically want the nice room with a decent deck overlooking the inner harbor side, is this that?

Agent:
The One Bedroom Suites with a king bed have a partial water view. Let me see what else we have available that has a good view

User:
ok

Agent:
We do have a One Bedroom Suite with one queen bed (same layout of room) on a high floor with an inner harbour view at the same price

User:
We're both tall, sorry we need a king.

Agent:
Ok, then I might suggest the Studios, as they have a better view than the One Bedrooms. They do still have the balcony with the furniture, and the four piece marble bathrooms

User:
Hold on, I'll look online.

Agent:
They are the ones available at $384 CAD + taxes

User:
I want it to be special, so a larger deck with king is my desire, very nice bathroom in the studio thought.

User:
Bedroom suite have a king bed?

Agent:
Yes, we do have the One Bedroom Suite with a king bed, which is currently what you are reserved in. They only have a partial view of the water though. You can see the water from the balcony, just not from the room itself

User:
The one in the picture online looks like the deck is like 500 Sq. Ft. is that true?

User:
Also what floor is the room I have booked, a higher one is preferred.

Agent:
The suite is about 550 sq feet all together. The balcony is about 150 sq ft

Agent:
These suites are anywhere from the 2-4th floor. I'll note your request for a high floor

User:
Can the Empress be seen from inside the room?

Agent:
No unfortunately not

User:
Which direction of the compass is the room facing? I want to see the city at night from the room.

User:
& yes the Empress, what room do I need for this?

User:
Have I wore out my welcome?

Agent:
Sorry, I was just on the phone with a guest

User:
I have to leave soon & want to get this final. Thanks

Agent:
Your best option for a view of the Empress would be an Erickson Wing Studio. We cannot guarantee it, but this would be your best choice for view of the Empress

User:
Should I move to the executive suite to achieve my desire?

User:
Does that room have a king?

Agent:
Yes, that would be the best view of the City, as you are on the 5th floor with a view of the Inner Harbour

Agent:
The Executive does have a king bed

Agent:
The Executive Suite is about 800 sq feet in size just to give you an idea

User:
Any cheaper options that fit my need?

Agent:
And the balcony is about 200 sq feet

User:
What's my best rate for the Executive?

Agent:
The Executive is selling at $764 CAD + taxes, and we have AAA or Seniors discounts available

User:
We're 56(;}

Agent:
Ok! Well you do qualify, and that would bring the rate down to $687 CAD + taxes

User:
Oh come on, we're ole buddies at this point, through me a bone, a oncve in a lifetime Golden anniversary.

Agent:
I know, but unfortunately the Executive is one of our Specialty Suites, and that is the best discount we have

User:
Am I gonna have to sweep up to get the best rate?

User:
Regardless, let's change my reservation.

User:
I'm feeling executive.

User:
can you send a confirmation to bcampbell@surgentinc.com

Agent:
Yes I will send it to you shortly. You are now confirmed in the Executive Suite

User:

User:
Hi,

Agent:
Hi there! There is at least one free walking tour in Copenhagen that starts at Rådhuspladsen (Town Square / City Hall) which is right in the middle of town and quite close to the hotel. 

This is the most comprehensive of the tours they offer and also the only one before noon - However, these tours go from 10, 11 and 12 AM and last 3 hours, which means you would have to take the one at 10 and then cut it short around 11:30 to be back at the hotel on time for the Wednesday, but on Tuesday you could take any of the three. 

They also offer a daily tour of Christiania from 4 PM, and a 'Classical' Tour of Copenhagen daily from 12 noon, these two tours start from Højbro Plads which is very close the the Town Hall

Hope that is of some help :)

There are a few options in terms of transportation from the airport to the hotel. The easiest is to catch the regional train which takes 15 minutes from the airport to the central station. The hotel is then just a few minutes walk from the station. A taxi from the airport will usually cost anywhere between 250-300 DKK depending on time of the day as well as traffic. There are lots of taxis to catch, so this should be quite an easy solution as well. I hope this was of help to you!

Afternoon, just wondering if you have a corporate room (HSE) available on the 8th May B&B - thank you

Agent:
Should you have any questions then please let me know.

Agent:
For May 8, 2018, we do have rooms available. It's currently a better value to reserve a 'room only' booking, and purchase breakfast separately. The best room-only rate for a Deluxe King room would be $245.40 CDN before tax, under our 'Early Bird' promotion. The cruise terminal is in downtown Vancouver; unfortunately we do not have a shuttle running that far. I'm not certain what taxi fare would be, but the ride is I believe about 30 minutes on average. I would recommend speaking with our hotel concierge for more detailed info and suggestions for transportation over to the port.

Agent:
Kære Henning, jeg vil gerne assistere dig, men jeg bliver dog nødt til at bede dig om at skrive pænt, da det faktisk sidder en person her på den anden side af skærmen. Hvilken datoer er du interesseret i?

User:
Beklager. Det er ofte for mange rare problemer med online systemer.  MIn ikke så pene uttalelse handler om det automatiske systemet.  Jeg er meget glad for å møte et menneske. Det er snakk om 24/11 til 25/11 en natt oh et bra rom.

Agent:
Det kan jeg godt klare Henning, jeg går ud fra at du er den samme Henning Fjøs, som har boet her før, så at jeg kan bruge den profil vi har i systemet. Har du brug for enkelt eller doublet room?

User:
Ja, det er det. Jeg og min frue vil gjerne tilbake til deres hotell.

User:
Det betyr dobbeltrom

User:
Hallo...?

User:
Hallo, er det noen der???

Agent:
Hej igen Henning, jeg laver en reservation og sender dig bekræftelsen.

User:
OK flott! Takk!

Takk uansett, det er godt å møte en person når de frustrerende online systemene ikke fungerer. God aften.

Hey there, I just checked and we do have some rooms for rent in November. I would suggest calling our booking office for the best possible deal :). Our booking office is open from 08:00 to 16:00 danish time. Hope this helped

User:
Not at all. You have been most unhelpful. I'll book at Skt Petri.

User:
I'll also be sure to provide detailed feedback to your management about the whole booking process and why I have no desire to everagain visit your hotel. You are amongst the most unprofessional people I have ever come across. Sorry to say. :(

User:
I hope you go bankrupt. Thank you!

Agent:
Hi Henning, reservationen var jo lavet som jeg lovede. Jeg havde sendt bekræftelsen på email til din mail henning@fjoes.net. Det kunne jo være at den havde landet i papirkurven... og igen vil jeg huske dig på at det faktisk er mennesker som sidder har på den anden side af skærmen og derfor er det intet galt ved at skrive pænt. SKulle du have nogle problemer er du velkommen til at skrive direkte til mig på grm@andersen-hotel.dk. Jeg vil så tage mig af de klager som vi får, da jeg er Guest Relation manager her i huset. Mvh. Lára G. Lindgreen

User:
Den reservasjonen kom aldri til min email. Jeg har ingen "papirkurv".  Jeg forstår ikke hva du mener med at skrive pænt.  Jeg har ikke gjort annet enn å beskrive helt saklig min opplevelse med å forsøke å booke hos dere. Når jeg beskriver dere som upofesjonelle er ikke det "stygt", der et korrekt. Jeh aldr noensinne vært i kontakt med mer uprofesjonelle folk enn dere. Til å starte med, burder dere kanskje være mer opptatt av å levere produktet deres enn å be folk om å snakke "pæmt".  Det er mennesker som sitter på andre siden også og vi setter ikke pris på å bli ignorert.

Uansett, jeg har booket på Skt Petri, så slutt på diskusjonen.

Since this is the week of move-in on campus, it has a 7 day cancellation date. If you change your reservation at least 7 days out, you will not be charged for cancelling. During our regular times, you can cancel your reservation up to 24 hours ahead.

Thank you for the note. Hotels in Miami Beach traditionally run Florida Residents specials to attract locals during low season.

Dear guest, could you kindly provide us with your arrival time in the number of guests so that we can send you an offer?

Agent:
Unfortunately we are sold out for those dates.

Agent:
CAA saves you 10% off room only but you pay for parking. Packages on this page have parking included and the room is discounted as well. The Bed & Breakfast package usually works out to be the best deal if you'll be dining each morning and have a vehicle.

Agent:
Since we are currently sold out at the moment the system will not allow me to see if there is a 2 night minimum but it is safe to assume that we will be enforcing it on any given weekend during summer time.

X1 is the bus from the airport to here , it leaves every hour , the bus stop is just 5 minutes by foot from the hotel and it ,s called Luna :)

User:
one more question

Agent:
HI sure thing-

User:
I am looking for about 8 nights stay  for 3 peoplein August between 8/6 - 8/18

User:
preferably with breakfast

User:
this is why I was thinking about bedroom suite

Agent:
Is it for 3 adults?

User:
but I do not see it is available...

User:
yes

User:
for 3 adults

Agent:
Starting Aug 13 there is avail for 8 nights.

Agent:
For Aug.13th for eight nights the average rate is $427+taxes per night for the Bedroom Suite with 3 adults.

User:
wow

Agent:
That's about $322+taxes in US currently

User:
anything less expensive which can accommodate 3 peple?

Agent:
Let me take a look for you.

User:
please

Agent:
I have an Erickson Wing Studio with two queen beds available Aug.6 for 4nts or Aug.12 for 5nts. So you still get a balcony you can sit out on and the larger bathroom which is nice.

Agent:
Do you have AAA or would you qualify for a Seniors Rate?

Agent:
Ooh and I have another great option in your preferred dates. We have an Inner Harbour Bedroom Suite that has a king size bed in the bedroom and a double size pull out sofa in the living room. It looks towards downtown Victoria. There isn't a picture on the website of this room unfortunately. There is a patio you can sit out on as well. It is located in our Laurel Wing but has the same larger bathroom as the Erickson Wing. I have that one available for Aug. 7 for 8 nights at an average rate of  $417+taxes per night.

User:
so,there is not water view, correct?

Agent:
Because we have the availability in the Inner Harbour Bedroom Suite for over 7 nights you would qualify for our weekly rate. So this room would be at an average rate of $354+taxes per night. Or about $267+taxes per night at today's US exchange rate.

Agent:
Yes, this one has an inner harbour view and looks towards downtown.

User:
I hope there is no outside nois

User:
noise

Agent:
It actually has a better view than the Bedroom Suites in the Erickson Wing truthfully.

User:
husband is very sensitive

User:
I c

Agent:
No, we are away from the hustle and bustle of downtown.

User:
will breakfast be included in this deal?

User:
or I need to pay extra?

Agent:
We don't have breakfast included in our weekly rate so it would be additional.

User:
how much may I ask?

Agent:
To add on breakfast it would be $21.50+15%gratuity +5% taxes so about $25.96 including grat and tax per adult each day. You would have a choice from 3 entrees in our restaurant plus coffee or tea plus juice. The choices are Point Breakfast (eggs & meat), continental or eggs benny.

Treću godinu za redom u okviru projekta "Najbolji edukatori" nagrađujemo Najbolje edukatore Srbije, više o projektu možete pogledati ovde.

Zanima me da li imate sale koje bi nama odgovarale, kao i da li je moguće zakazati sastanak kako bismo mi to videli do srede, najkasnije četvrtka?

Za sve dalje informacije, stojim Vam na raspolaganju.

I could get both tomorrow and bring it over and then it would be amazing if she could receive it on Sunday (perhaps put in the room or at the counter during check out).  Please let me know if this could work :) I am also reachable on phone 91802691. Thanks a lot

=====
User:
I am not seeing how I can book the 124 rate ?

Agent:
Though we do not have our own shuttle, there is a company called YYJ Airporter Shuttle http://www.yyjairportshuttle.com/ which provides service between the airport and the hotels downtown, including ours.  The kiosk is located near the arrivals gate and you do not need reservations for pick-up as they are there whenever flights are departing or arriving. The cost is $25 per person each way, and to compare, the cost of a cab is approximately $60 one way. 

You can also take public transit which is less expensive at $2.50, however it requires a transfer as well as a ten minute walk, which may be uncomfortable depending on how much luggage you have. You would take the #80 from the Airport and connect to the #70 in Sidney, travel into downtown Victoria and then get off  at Douglas at Bellville and walk the rest of the way. The best way to find times is by following directions on BC Transit's website: http://www.busonline.ca/regions/vic/tripplanner.cfm

I am sorry, i did wrote the wrong amount. The first night price was 1350 DKK,- so we did charge 1350 DKK,- 
The next 3 nights is 1550 DKK,- each so in total for the whole stay it should have been 6000 DKK,- Would you like the invoice sent to your email where you can see the amount we charged your credit card for the first night?

I would be able to offer a rate of $359 + taxes per evening for a Signature King room or $489 + taxes per evening for a One Bedroom Suite,  Both rooms would have a 14 day cancellation policy.  These rooms don't offer a kitchenette but we could have a small fridge or microwave placed in the room at no extra cost.  If you were looking for a kitchenette the only room we would have available would be our Halo Penthouse which would be available for $3500 + taxes per evening.

The Laurel wing guest room with couch

Agent:
Thank you for your inquiry & have a good day ahead.

Agent:
For the basic shower room, it is $99. Unfortunately it's all we have left. It's a standing shower bathroom and very small rooms. They are definitely the most economical rooms we have, but are not up to the quality standard as the rest of our rooms.

Agent:
Sorry, no suites that are pet friendly. The guest room is pet friendly and available, but it has the king bed and the sitting area all in the one room

User:

=====

We don't usually rent these out unless we absolutely have to. If you're just planning to sleep there and not stay in your room very much, then it's great. If you're planning on relaxing and spending time in the room, then I would not recommend it.

they are getting the rooms for 4 nights for 751 euros, but i'm not seeing that rate

Agent:
we are about a 30 min drive from wynwood.

Agent:
Most certainly.

Agent:
The classic double room only has a queen bed which can not be made up as a twin. You will need to reserve a room with a king bed as these are the rooms we can make up as a twin.

Agent:
If you are looking for something slightly more spacious, we would recommend choosing one of our executive rooms or a suite.

Agent:
Oh, this may because you've checked a special rate such as government,etc.

Agent:
You would need to reserve a deluxe king room which has a king bed and sofa bed. The rate on the best available including breakfast and VAT is £390.00 and our advance purchase rate is £331.50. These rates are per room per night.

Agent:
Hello,  Would you be able to give me a bit more information as to where they are seeing this rate from?

The cost is $25 per person each way, and to compare, the cost of a cab is approximately $60 one way.

Good afternoon, I applied for the Front Desk Agent last week and I was curious if you've filled the vacancy?

Agent:
Every hotel in the area is going to have a waiting list - especially for an SEC game. Also, prices are going to be triple the normal price. To be completely honest, I would recommend looking for an Airbnb or VRBO. If you are especially keen on staying in a hotel, I would recommend the Courtyard Marriott which is right across the street from us.

Agent:
The room type is a Cool Double. The price in US is approx 800,- dollars

You can take all the train from Oceankaj to Central Station of Copenhagen. Depends which train you are taking, it will be 2-4 stops. 
Some cruises is really close to the train station, and others are not close to the station and you have to walk for 10 minutes with your luggage. So it depends how close you are from the cruiseship to the station as Oceankey is really long.

Dear Manager

I am currently on a weight loss challenge to lose 6 stone. I am taking on physical challenges along my journey, and for each  challenge I take on I raise funds for different charities.

When I reach my target weight-loss I am planning to have a masquerade ball. The reason behind this is I plan to donate all monies brought in from ticket sales and raffle to be split evenly among all the charities that we did challenges for throughout the year. 

I am contacting different hotels in the area to see what you could offer us. We would hope to have about 250 in attendance to include to drinks reception and a meal.
Our preferred date would be any Saturday in December. We will organise to have a band and DJ for the night. 

Can you come back to me with your availability , what price per person it would cost and what you can offer us? 

I look forward to your reply. 

Kind regards

It would feature a combination tub and shower and a standing room only balcony. The nightly rate would be $294.00 CAN plus taxes and fees and a $30.00 nightly Pet fee.

so those nights should be covered by room rate - correct?

The parking package up to 22 nights of parking includes the night your arrive to park the car. Any additional parking after 22 nights is $5 per night.

Lisa R quoted above:

Agent:
No, because the parking package only covers up to 22 nights starting from Sept 14 therefore, parking is covered up to Oct. 5 anything after is $5 extra per night.

User:
We will think about this

Agent:
If you don't mind. I'll have to speak with Lisa on what she had told you because I scrolled up the message chat and only see "On Sep 14th based on double occupancy we have a deluxe king at $272 CAD plus tax which includes the 1 night stay on 14th and 22 nights of parking. The extra 2 nights of parking will be $5 CAD plus tax per night. On Oct 8 staying for the 1 night I have $149.40 CAD plus tax."

Hello .. Morning.. Saya dari UiTM ingin bertanya tentang saiz Banquet/ Dewan Besar Impiana.. Full Strength dewan boleh masuk berapa ramai - dan adakah impiana pernah menerima majlis Regimental Dinner? tq.

Agent:
Greetings from Impiana KLCC Hotel. For inquiries on room rates please do email to masnizah.othman@impiana.com

Agent:
Just to let you know, these things will be provided.

Agent:
Hej Gunnar, vi leder efter den og du vil høre nærmere snarest muligt.

User:
Hello. I need your best rate please for a twin or large double room for 9 May for 3 nights with breakfast if possible. Thanks

Agent:
Hi, thank you for getting in touch. Our grand ballroom can accommodate  up to 200pax. Yes, we did 'Majlis Regimental Dinner' before.

Agent:
Thank you for your inquiry & have a good day ahead.

Agent:
If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to contact us on here again.

User:
hi there,

Agent:
Hi  - we can offer a Cool twin at DKK 1240 or Brilliant twin at DKK 1400 per night including breakfast from the 9 - 12 May

User:
OK. Whats the basic difference between the 2 rooms please

User:
I was booked under a deluxe king room with 3pax under reservation no : 2226746, may i know if this deluxe king room can accommodate for three pax?

Agent:
The Cool is our standard small double rooms and the Brilliant is deluxe rooms

Agent:
Greetings from Impiana KLCC Hotel.  Please do call 03-21471027 or email to reservations.iklcc@impiana.com

Agent:
Size and most Brilliant rooms are facing the courtyard

=====
User:
Not sure it's the best price. Senior rate says it's 30% off best rate and includes complimentary b'fast buffet, but the price is $30 more than best rate. Looks like you're just charging for the "free" b'fast.

User:
are there tea making facilities in all rooms and if we went for the brilliant twin can we request a quiet courtyard room now please ?

Agent:
Hi there, thanks for your message. The 30% off rate (Early Bird Rate, booked at least 14 days in advance) is $196, the same as the Senior's rate. The Senior's rate is better because it does include the complimentary buffet breakfast for 2 (a $50 value). The rate you've noted above ($167.40) is our Early Bird Rate, booked at least 30 days in advance, which is why it's a bit lower. To decide which one is best, it depends on whether you'd want the buffet breakfast included. If you're departing early, or otherwise can't take advantage of the meal, you would be better off booking the Early Bird, 30 days rate of $167.40.

Agent:
Yes tea and coffee facilities in all rooms - and yes we can offer courtyard facing Briliant twin - do you wish to go ahead and book?

=====

I'm very grad to hear from you, kindly advise me by return e-mail pleased

User:
is this option of 2 superior garden rooms would be ok for all of us then?

is this what you mean?

Yes, 2 rooms of Superior Garden at THB 4,400net per room per night is all right for your party. How old for child in 1st room?

Agent:
For 2nd room child 1 years we can arrange baby cot by complimentary.

if child 4 years above sharing bed with parent is free of charge, Breakfast will be charge at THB 250net per child per meals

User:
room 1: 2 adults + 1 kid (9 yeras old)

User:
room 2: 2 adults + 1 kid (5 years old) + 1 baby (1 year old)

User:
would you be so kind to include transfer from and also TO the airport at this rate?

Agent:
I'm afraid if 2 + 2 child can not fit in Superior because it is maximum stay only 2 + 1 child below 12 years.

Agent:
Then, I would like to recommend Deluxe Garden at THB 5,600net per room per night

User:
can we make an exception, no baby cot and we go on this way? I mean room the baby and kid (5 yeras old) share with us the bed

Agent:
It would be all right for special case for you. However, there is no bay cot set up as you said all both your child sharing bed with you. Breakfast will be charge at THB 250net for child for this room. For infant 1 years is complimentary.

Agent:

Due to fire safety codes, the maximum occupancy for a standard room is 4 guests, including children, so with 5 guests, you would either need to book 2 regular rooms, or one of our 2 bedroom suites. Each Deluxe Room with 2 Double beds would be $209.30 CDN before tax, or a 2 Bedroom Suite would be $384.30 CDN before tax (room only).
Please feel free to contact us at any time if you have other questions, or would like to go ahead and make a reservation. We'll look forward to hearing back from you.

As the payment has been made to the hotel, I will inform the hotel for the date changes but the total of nights paid is still the same. I will inform the hotel that you will stay for one more night (check out on 20th july) and will.pay directly to the hotel.

Dear Sir or Madam,
 
today i booked a room from September 20th to September 21st in your hotel.
Now i have a few questions.

I have read that you offer a free shuttle service.
Is this only from the hotel to the airport, or also from the airport (when we arrive) to the hotel?
If so, where do we find this shuttleservice at the airport and at what times does this? Do we have to register?
Our plane lands on 20.9. at 10.55am, until we have our luggage and get out, it will be about 11.30am.
 
Is it possible to get a room on the top floor, with great views of the harbor?
 
Is on 20.9. Evening the Richmond Night market?
 
We have to pick up our camper on 21.9.
The address is: Cruise Canada RV Rental & Sales, 7731 Vantage Way, Delta, BC V4G 1A6, Canada.
Can you tell me which connection to the public transport is available, or how much is a taxi from your hotel to the rental station?
 
I am looking forward to your reply,
and many greets from Germany,
Coinna Gruber

Hi,

I stayed in the hotel from the 17th to 19th April, and bought a ticket for the Tivoli from reception on the 17th, at 17.10. I was in Copenhagen on a business trip, so I asked the receptionist to charge my ticket to my personal debit card, and he did so, and money was taken from my personal card. However, the same amount of money was taken out of my work credit card at the end of my stay when I paid for the room. 

Therefore, I paid for 2 tickets to the Tivoli, one on my personal bank account and one with my work bank account, and was only given one ticket.

I would like a refund for one ticket please.

Thank you,
Anisha Lakhani

Agent:
Thank you so much for your feedback Ms. Sterman! I am happy to place the booking on the waitlist if you'd like should anything become available we would be reaching out. If you are looking for a property close in proximity to the Loden the closest hotels would be the Hyatt Regency and Coast Coal Harbour

Agent:
The hotel is located in the heart of South Beach. Everything is centrally located and within walking distance of the hotel

User:
We're looking for a small beautiful hotel like your (as close as it can be like yours)

Agent:
While everything is nearby, should you want to explore outside of the city, we can assist in renting cars as well.

Certainly. In terms of boutique style properties I believe the Wedgewood is located in the area, though not the same feel as the Loden it would be similar in terms of size boutique feel.

User:
If I book now do I pay now or upon arrival?

User:
they do not have availability

Agent:
ONly the first night deposit is required to guarantee the booking. Remaining balance is due at arrival

Agent:
I am sorry to hear that Ms. Sterman, this is a very busy time in the city. My suggestion would therefore be to try looking on Tripadvisor or Expedia which properties would have availability for these dates.

We usually not allow children over the age of two to sleep with the parents in the same bed as our beds are Queensize.

Hello happy summer. My husband and I run a youth camp in rural Alaska that takes the wind out of our sails by the end of the summer. I am a nursing teacher and my husband a hard working  remote worker for teaching and helping water plant workers  keep 15 villages of rural Alaska  water and sewer working.

User:
Today is our 25th wedding anniversary and unfortunately due to commitments we are unable to go anywhere.  However on this our anniversary we are planning a special trip the beginning of August.  I see you have various packages and wonder if you could let me know how this would work to get a few of them during a stay with you.

Agent:
Good Afternoon, which dates and packages are you interested in?

User:
Well thank you for responding. dates are  Wednesday August 9th through August 13

User:
Did I mention we went to Victoria for our honeymoon?  :-)

User:
Looking at spicing up marriage so the naughty package and then the butchart garden. I wondered with the butchart gardens about transportation to gardens?

Agent:
We can definitely arrange both of these packages for you - Currently we do have very limited availability over your dates. Let me just take a look and see what we can do for you

Agent:
Transportation out to the gardens is not included in the package, you would need to take the local bus, a taxi or you can book a shuttle service through CVS tours.

User:
Great thanks. Even if it is a couple of those  dates at front or end of our stay we can always  do other accomodations

User:
ok thank you for the info on the gardens

User:
we do have alternative dates possible of August 7 &8th

Agent:
We can accommodate you for the full duration in one of our Erickson Wing Studio rooms with 1 king bed. With the Butchart Gardens package the nightly rate would be $428.30 on average, plus taxes and fees. This would include breakfast each day, your entry to the gardens and complimentary parking (if needed).

Agent:
To add on the naughty package, it would be an additional $125 plus taxes

Agent:
The quoted rates are in Canadian Dollars

User:
Oh that makes some sense what is the cost in US? and I do not see the Erickson Wing Studio on your website?

Agent:
http://laurelpoint.com/studios/

Agent:
Approximate nightly rate is $322.64 USD, and the naughty package would be about $94 USD

User:
Great thanks

User:
Ok let think on this a few min. will be back in a few minutes.

Agent:
You're welcome!

User:
Is this with taxes included?

Agent:
The rates quoted are not including tax

User:
ok  is there any better rate I don't mean to be miserly but I see the same room on a hotel discount site of 287 US . If I get that room can I add the romance part?

User:
How much are taxes?

User:
Do you have the naughty romance package available Monday August 7th?

Agent:
I believe the rate you are viewing would be just the room, not including the Butchart Gardens package, which I have included in the quote and then also quoted you to add on the extras from the naughty package. We can certainly book in just the room, and then add on the package however this would only give you breakfast for one day, if you wanted breakfast daily we would need to look at package pricing.

Agent:
Rates also do fluctuate daily so depending on which days you are looking at, the rates could be different.

Agent:
Taxes are 17.16%

User:
yes I am realizing this is a real industry now just getting a hotel :-) I miss the days of just making the reservation. :-)

Agent:
You can always make a reservation and change it later depending on availability. We just need 24 hours notice prior to check in for cancellations.

User:
Good to know. WE are actually there for a week so I am trying to figure a plan out. will have some dates shortly.  Can I make reservations through the website or shall I call?

Agent:
Either or is fine, we can be reached toll-free at 1.800.663.7667

User:
Ok great thank you so much for your help!

Agent:
You are most welcome!

=====
User:
I see there is a spa option and wonder if there are any couples massage?

Agent:
We have Inn Room Spa Services but would require a date and time which you would like the massages to take place on in order to inquire with our mobile spa company if they are available.

Agent:
They do offer couples massages, however not all rooms can accommodate both massage tables.

User:
Great thanks that helps.

=====
User:
Ya! So What rooms are available for Monday August 7 and 8th for one day naughty romance and  instead of the Buchart gardens how does the 150 food tour work? Is that a package or separate?

Agent:
Hi we have Laurel Wing Guest Rooms available and Erickson Wing Studios for the nights of 7th & 8th August.  The 150 food tour gets 20% discount when booked with the 150 Package.  The Package includes a Canadian Welcome amenity from the Pastry Chef, Ketchup Chips, 650ml bottle Driftwood Fat Tug Beer and breakfast for 2 in Aura from a choice of Entres and Complimentary Parking.

=====
User:
Thank you for expanding and sticking with my million questions.  Just a few  more questions . If you were on a slight budget and desired a King bed and nice view  which room would you pick?  How much is the Nughty  Romance  package?

Agent:
Hi the Erickson Wing Studios are certainly more luxurious and larger to celebrate a special occassion.  They have a large 4 piece Marble bathroom and a larger outside balcony with Patio furniture.  The Laurel Wing guest rooms are comfortable with a combination bath and shower and a small standing room balcony.  The rate for Naughty Package for the Erickson Wing at that time is $1073.99 which includes the Naughty Kit and Sparkling wine and chocolate desert 1 night and breakfast and parking for the both nights and a 2pm checkout.  The Laurel wing guest room is $839.67 for the same package.

User:
Could a double massage be done in teh Laurel wing guest room?

Agent:
Yes in a Laurel Wing Guest Room with a king Bed

User:
Wonderful  does the lower priced room also have a standing balcony ?

User:
If so Im sold!

Agent:
Yes it has a standing Room Balcony

User:
Great!

The minifridges in the rooms are not fridges, per say. They are more like cooling boxes. However, if you need something you would like to keep cold, then you can always use the fridges in the kitchen. Rooms are allocated on arrival day and it depends on availability. We do take into consideration the wishes of our guests. However we cannot promise that there will be "quiet" rooms available when you arrive.

They run every hour in the summer from 9am-5pm. Their information can be found here: http://www.cvstours.com/sightseeing-tours/

Hi Kilmurry Lodge Hotel! I got a question. On the 4 and 5th of May there is a COST ACTION meeting in Limmerick. I've been told that this hostel would hold rooms until the 25th of April for 72 euro a night. The reference code is: 237920. How can I book a single room with this reference code?

There are two options: Taxi or Train. You can take the train, which is connected to the airport terminal 3, to the Central Station. The journey takes apx. 15-20 mins, from the central station we are located within a 5 min walking distance. You can take a taxi from the airport to our front door, for a price which runs around 250DKK, give or take depending on traffic and time of day.

It should come through within the next hour or so

Now I am left with a bill for a room for 161.10 euro. I was wondering if it is at all possible that I could be refunded part of the payment. I myself am going into hospital and the stress of everything is just getting to me... I would appreciate any refund .. Thank you Teresa  Leech. leechteresa@yahoo.ie

Hi there,

I'd like ask one thing about check-out time

User:
we want to check in August 10th

User:
is late check-out available at that day?

User:
If so, how much we should pay more and how long we can stay?

Agent:
What time are you requesting to check out at?

User:
hopefully 3pm

Agent:
We offer complimentary check- out until 1pm but a 3pm checkout would be a $30.00 plus tax charge

User:
is it always available ?

User:
we will use expedia for reservation

User:
is it okay to let the receptionist know when we are check - in?

Agent:
Our late check-out availability is dependent upon our occupancy levels.

Agent:
If you book a reservation on expedia, the system should automatically sync with our system. If you want to make sure we have your reservation in our system, please do not hesitate to contact us 24 hours after making your expedia booking.

Agent:
If you are inquiring about late check-out, you can request it during check-in with the front desk agent.

User:
so that means there is a possibility that you might not be able to offer late check-out?

Agent:
Unfortunately, that is true.

User:
Is there any way for us to have late check-out for sure?

User:
we can make a reservation and pay now

Agent:
Is 3pm the latest you are requesting to check-out?

User:
yes

Agent:
If 3pm is definite, there should not be a problem to guarantee a late check out

User:
so we can just tell the front when we check-in?

Agent:
That is correct.

I can see the confusion, the parking is free if you book a non-refundable rate. Otherwise you will only get 30% discount on the parking in the garage if you book one of the other offers. But I'm actually offering you free parking in this open parking space. And yes it is safe. But not patrolled.

Dear Sir/ Madam, 
I am interested in reserving  an "Elegance Double Room", from April 24- April 30th, provided someone can guarantee that my room has (1) Roll Top Bath (very important), and (2) is on quiet side of the building (also important): - far from kitchen, -  far from the elevator;  highest (3rd ?) floor ?  e.g. PLEASE (!!!) GIVE THE BEST ONE YOU HAVE GOT ! Can you do it? If so, - you just got a new customer, and potentially 5* review! 

PS Expedia lists  Elegance Double Room for my dates for Total of $1,113.77, But I would prefer to fdeal with you directly, e.g.  assume the total cost of 1284.48 USD / 6 nights (including all fees and taxes, based on your web site info).  PLEASE CONFIRM the above by emailing me directly at novosad@anl.gov  (to : Dr Valentine Novosad)

Okay, well if you want to email me through your details on reservations@fleetstreethotel.com I can provisionally book you a room & then it is there if you do need it, but we can cancel with no charge if you don't get a flight.

i asked for the rate with taxes but the message has been taken off the board.It said I needed the Bedford room 5 aug to 13th aug. i will call the hotel if Ido not hear back. cheers Penny

Agent:
Thank you Mr Brown! May I also have your home address?

Agent:
I'm sorry to inform you but our Bedford Double are all sold out from Aug 5th or Aug 13th. Is there any other dates we can accommodate? I can suggest booking two separate rooms if you like. The average nightly rate for the Grove Queen for that length stay is $290 USD but I could offer a 10% discount on the rate which comes out to $261.50 USD average per night. Because you are staying 3 night and longer, there is a 15% promotion rate discount which makes it $246.13 USD. If booked under this promotion, a full deposit of the stay has to be made and it is non-refundable. If you have any further questions, you can always call us directly for an immediate answer. Thank you.

jost218@hotmail - thank you

Agent:
Thank you. The rate on June 24, 2017 for a deluxe room with two queen beds is $185 CAD plus taxes and if you like to upgrade to our two bedroom suite, it's an upgrade charge of $250 CAD plus taxes. Therefore, the total price with the upgrade is $435 CAD plus taxes. For the return stay it's the same price.

Agent:
Good Morning.

=====
User:
you too

User:
sorry - email is  jost218@hotmail.com

User:
Just so I am clear, and the reason for my checking. The PROMO Rate for WRESORTS is showing 155 for a deluxe King. It seems it would be a better price to just get two rooms instead of a two room suite.

Agent:
Which month?

=====
User:
How close are you to the cruise port?

User:
Do you have dates from the 9th - 16th September available for the three bedroomed villa? Any dates in September would actually be ok - thanks

Agent:
That is correct. The $155 rate is based on double occupancy but you mentioned there will be a 3rd adult in the room that is why the rate is $185

Agent:
July 22nd?

User:
also, is it possible to take a train from the airport to t he hotel?

Agent:
Hello

Agent:
Yes, you are also correct. The best value would be getting two rooms vs. a two bedroom suite.

User:
This month

Agent:
Hello sorry for the delay.

Agent:
Yes we do have Three Bedroom Villa available on 09th until 16th September 2017.

=====
User:
Thanks

Agent:
The day use rooms are not available this saturday

Agent:
From the airport you can take the train towards the central station which takes 15 minutes. From there you can walk to us within 3 minutes.

User:
Thank you for that - could you tell me the price please? Also my sister-in-law and family have been to you several times and loved it and recommend a villa close to the Prana and across the road from Le Spot Deli. Would you require a deposit or full payment?

Agent:
My pleasure.

User:
Ok thank you

Agent:
The cruise terminal is a 15 minute taxi ride away from the hotel. You can also take a bus, but you would have to walk about 500 meters from where the bus drops you off.

User:
Just remembered you had given me a price !! Sorry! I'm presuming it's $3097.50?

Are you interested in booking with me today? I can call you if you  like.

Just looking at the same period this year, I can go ahead and extend you a special rate for that period in August 2018 of $259+ taxes for a Superior King, $279+ taxes for a Deluxe King which is more spacious, or since you are here for a week, we have the Superior Suite (this has a King bed in the bedroom and a sitting area with a pull out sofa bed and is approximately 400 sq ft) which we can offer at a special rate of $369+ taxes per night,  Let me know if these rates work for you and I will be happy to go ahead and set up your reservation for next year.  Thank you and looking forward to hear back!

Agent:
Hi

Agent:
It's likely that's the pre-authorization, rather than a finalized charge. Generally, all hotels will pre-authorize a certain amount for any potential incidentals which may be incurred during your stay. Any portion not spent toward incidentals (dining, movies, etc.) is released upon checkout. Normally, it should appear back on your statement within about 5-7 business days, depending on your card and issuing bank.

Agent:
We have A/C in all our rooms :)

Agent:
Which room type?

so all the other conditions are the same?

From Waterfront station the taxi ride to the Loden would take roughly 10 minutes.

Our signature room is actually one of my favorite rooms as they have a nice sliding wall to the bathroom which opens up the space quite a bit. Although if you are looking for a view our Park Vista or Garden Terrace rooms would be a great option!

User:
(I normally don't spell this poorly - the screen keeps hopping around.)

User:
Excellent thank you

Agent:
Hello there,

Agent:
you are welcome...

Agent:
The Park Vista is a corner room offering a partial view of the water. This room is $60 more than the signature, so approximately $420 USD on the 21st. And then the Garden Terrace actually has a little step out patio that overlooks our urban oasis on the 2nd floor. It's a unique little green space with a running stream right outside your room. Very peaceful! The Garden Terrace rooms also include extra little amenities such as complimentary sauna sessions and yogi tea. These rooms are $100 more than the signature.

Agent:
I will gladly check if it is possible, may I have your last name that the booking is made in?

User:
Could you please tell me if your rates for the rooms are in $USD or $AUD ??

User:
Park Vista is $420 USD on the 21st and the Signature King is $418? I know you mentioned it's $60 more, was that for the 23rd instead or does that take out the included breakfast ? Just to clarify- sorry

User:
Joseph Howley

User:
The reason I ask is we have been invoiced for $2100.00 and was advertised as $1500.00 on your site!

Agent:
My apologies, the Park Vista on the 21st would be $460 USD.

Excellent.  Will you include room or room # in email?

Agent:
Though we do not have our own shuttle, there is a company called YYJ Airporter Shuttle http://www.yyjairportshuttle.com/ which provides service between the airport and the hotels downtown, including ours.  The kiosk is located near the arrivals gate and you do not need reservations for pick-up as they are there whenever flights are departing or arriving. The cost is $25 per person each way, and to compare, the cost of a cab is approximately $60 one way. 

You can also take public transit which is less expensive at $2.50, however it requires a transfer as well as a ten minute walk, which may be uncomfortable depending on how much luggage you have. You would take the #80 from the Airport and connect to the #70 in Sidney, travel into downtown Victoria and then get off  at Douglas at Bellville and walk the rest of the way. The best way to find times is by following directions on BC Transit's website: http://www.busonline.ca/regions/vic/tripplanner.cfm

Room number will be assigned on the 14th based on availability

User:
This was a junior suite in the Laurel Wing at the AAA rate. Does that mean within 24 hours of the arrival date?

Agent:
That's correct, so up until 4pm the day prior to arrival you are able to cancel at no charge

User:
Would the  summer deal offer lower rates?

User:
And is there any way to get from your hotel to downtown other than by walking?

User:
Are you still there?

Agent:
Sorry, was just taking a look at our rates for that time

User:
no problem

Agent:
Looks like the AAA discount would be the best available rate at $264 CAD/night + taxes. The Bed & Breakfast package is available at $312 CAD/night + taxes, this includes breakfast for two and parking

Agent:
In regards to getting downtown, our front desk staff can organise a taxi for you, and it would be $5-10 depending on where you needed to go

User:
The rate I'd seen online a few minutes ago was something like $206/night--less than for a smaller guestroom, so I'd assumed it would be a special on the junior suite.

User:
That may have been $206 USD

Agent:
Yes, $206 USD comes to approximately $264 CAD

User:
Are there any special offers in the Erickson Wing for those dates? It's just for me, and I qualify for both AAA and AARP rates, but I like a roomy room. And can one request a NO-pet room?

Agent:
We do have the Erickson Wing Studios with a king bed available. They are about 450 square feet in size, and the AAA/AARP discount is $354 CAD/night + tax, which is about $275 USD/night

Agent:
And you are able to request a no-pet room

User:
Thanks. I'll probably book the junior suite in the Laurel Wing then and request a no-pet room. Do all the rooms have good water views?

Agent:
The Junior Suites have a partial water view. If you were wanting a room with a good view in the Laurel Wing, I would suggest the Inner Harbour guest rooms ($291 CAD/night) or the Sunset rooms ($300 CAD/night)

User:
Okay. Thanks for all the info.

Agent:
You're very welcome! Let me know if you have any questions

User:
Thanks and goodbye.

The Sunset rooms have an outer harbour view (facing away from downtown). The Studios have either an inner or an outer harbour view depending on what side of the building you are on.

User:
Can I hold 2 rooms under shely

Agent:
Hi there, day rooms are available between 9am, checkout is 5pm. Anything later than 5 would need to be booked as an overnight stay. The day use rate for April 4 is at $90 for a Deluxe Queen room, based on double occupancy

Agent:
And just so you are aware, the Sunset rooms have a king bed and a double sized pullout couch

User:
Jillshely@gmail.com

User:
yes, I saw the pull out info.  Do you have a recommendation one over the other for views/location

Agent:
You are able to do that through our site and if you have any difficulty you can go ahead and give us a call and we can set you right up with those reservations

They both have great views. The only difference between the two is the bathroom - the Erickson Wing have the marble bathroom with a soaker tub. The Sunset room has a regular bathroom with a combination tub and shower

Our number is 831-458-9660

Can I or should I  request inner or outer harbor view when booking?  Recommendation for family with young kids?

User:
For 7 adults and 1 infant

Agent:
It's likely that's the pre-authorization, rather than a finalized charge. Generally, all hotels will pre-authorize
a certain amount for any potential incidentals which may be incurred during your stay. Any portion not spent toward incidentals (dining, movies, etc.) is released upon checkout. Normally, it should appear back on your statement within about 5-7 business days, depending on your card and issuing bank.

Just one moment, please.

Hi there, I can take a look for you. Do you have your confirmation number?

Agent:
There isn't a shuttle that comes directly to the hotel, but there are a few different options on how to get here from the ferry.
1. BC Ferries Connector - There are multiple locations which you can get on to the bus, the price will vary depending on which location you choose to board. Please follow this link to find pricing and schedule information: http://bcfconnector.com/travel-information/
2. Public Transit - Busses leave with the ferry arrivals times and drop passengers downtown (about 10 minutes away, by foot). This is the most economical option at $2.50 per person, and a schedule is found here: http://www.busonline.ca/regions/vic/schedules/schedule.cfm?line=70
3. Taxi - They recommend making a reservation, and the company we recommend is called Blue Bird Cabs. The taxi would cost approximately $55 and their website is here: http://www.taxicab.com/

Agent:
That would be the wonderfull or the junior suite.

Can you advise me if it would be possible for them to have a day room 7/8 hours and what the cost would be.

Hi there!

My name is Michael Sidofsky and I'm a professional photographer/social media influencer from Toronto, Canada. My Instagram profile @mindz.eye has a following of over 149,000 followers with very high engagement. Having recently worked with marquee brands such as Sony and Lincoln Motor Co, I wanted to reach out to see if you'd be interested in doing a social media collaboration. I'll be in New York City from May 19-23rd, 2017 and in exchange for accommodations, I could offer you promotional features on my platform.  In addition, I could offer some photography services to your hotel if you'd be interested. Please let me know at your earliest convenience if you'd like to discuss my proposal further.


 

Best,

Michael

Our shuttle bus is complimentary and runs 24 hours a day. No need to call ahead to book as it is on an automatic schedule.  From the airport, the shuttle leaves every 20 minutes starting from the 10 after (x:10, x:30, x:50, etc). If you are arriving domestic, go down one level from baggage claims and go out the doors to your left. If you are arriving on the international side, exit out the international arrival doors and proceed to the green awning.

Good Morning. It looks like when you booked last year it was only a couple days before your arrival. Sometimes if we have a lot of open availability close to the arrival date the rates do drop. You also booked with the promotional rate that if you stay 3 nights you save 15%.

Unfortunately due to our availability that Luxury King Suite is the only room I could wave the two night minimum for. If you need multiple rooms other then the one I offered, the two night minimum is still in effect. So it would have to be a Friday-Saturday night stay or a Saturday-Sunday night stay.

User:
ok thanks

User:
thank you very much

Agent:
What did the bad review say? Our concept 24 is an option for late check-outs when making direct reservations with us. It basically means you can request a late check-out as late as you checked in. So if you check-in at 4pm you can request a late check-out for 4pm -free of charge.

Agent:
You're welcome! Let me know if you have any other questions

Agent:
I'm afraid we are sold out completely on Friday, and have a couple rooms left for Saturday

User:
Here was one review and I realize you have since added A/C to every room: Hotel is open air extremely warm in July afternoons. Erotic shops and strip clubs are on each and every street to the hotel. Hookers congrats on the corner being loud until they were chased off by a local resident.

User:
look forward to your confirmation

Agent:
We have two sister properties in the area if you'd like me to check those? The Majestic Hotel and the City Suites

Agent:
Yes, correct we just finished a thorough renovation of the entire hotel. There are erotic shops and strip clubs in the area, unfortunately some hookers too although harmless. But there are not any issues regarding safety as long as you take care of yourself, like any other big city.

Agent:
Great, it will come through in the next hour or so

User:
Hi,

I stayed with your hotel between 15th to 17th April 2017. My confirmation number is 16728644. While I checked-in I specifically asked your front desk manager who helped me with the checkin if there is free parking available for guests inside the hotel and he replied yes and asked me to park in the space in the front of the hotel and he took down my car registration number but while I checked out there was different person in the front desk and that lady told me that I will be charged for the parking for two days at CAD20 per day, I told her that I was not told about this CAD 20 per day charge and that I should not be charged. When I got back to the USA and checked my credit card bill, I was charged USD 28.40 which is not fair. 

This is a  small amount but there should be fair practice, probably your front desk manager forgot to tell me about the CAD 20 charge per day. As a customer I feel that I am being conned. I suggest that you refund this amount, so that it is straight and fair. If you choose not to refund, I will not be staying in your property again, losing one customer might not be a big deal for you but it’s important to be fair to your customers.

Agent:
Hi there, many thanks for your chat.
Can you please advise on which date you wish to arrive ?

Hello, I'm extremely flexible with my travel dates; when is the cheapest time of the year to book the Jacuzzi Suite?  I'm  assuming it'll be mid-week.  Many thanks.

Agent:
Thank you for your inquiry & have a good day ahead.

Agent:
As our rates fluctuate on a daily basis, it is quite difficult to say, however, our low season is November - March.

Agent:
How many nights for would you be looking to stay with us?

User:
It will be two nights, a brief trip.

Agent:
Could you be a little more specific regarding the month you would prefer?

User:
That's the thing, we can travel anytime so we're willing to work around your cheapest months.  I see from checking availability on the website that it's £533 for two nights mid week in September (romance package) for example.  That's the cheapest I've seen it

Agent:
Very interesting! I am looking at the month of September and the lowest price for a Jacuzzi Suite I can see is £391 per night and that would not include the Romance Package. The cheapest option I am able to locate would be weekdays in January available at £289 per night for our Flexible Best Available Rate.

User:
Maybe I was looking at the wrong results!  The information you've provided is very useful, thank you very much!  I'll get in touch when we decide to make a booking.

Agent:
My pleasure! Booking direct with ourselves will also entitle you to a Half Bottle of Fizzante, so please do not hesitate to contact us via email on reservations@niracaledonia.com or telephone on +44 131 225 2720.

User:
That's wonderful!  Out of interest, what is the difference between your jacuzzi suites?  I see on the website that each is slightly different.  Does one have a better view, larger TV etc...?  I can't find many photos of the room on the website, just angles of the jacuzzi

User:
Also, one of the photos shows a huge number of candles around the bath (I love it)!  Would we actually have all of those candles?

Agent:
All of our rooms are different in regards to their design etc., however, they all feature same amenities. We do not guarantee specific rooms to be available in case of unforeseen circumstances such as maintenance issues etc.

Agent:

To the staff at the Time New York hotel, 
Myself and a best friend are traveling to NYC to celebrate her 30th birthday, It will also be a reunion as she is traveling from New Zealand and myself from living in London for the past 2 years.
 I was hoping, if it was at all possible that there was something special you could do for our stay with you and or our time in NYC. We would both really appreciate it and I'm sure she would be surprised as she doesn't know about any of this. Our reservation with you Is 1993.363.620 checking in on 04.05.17 and checking out 08.05.17
Anything would be amazing but if not I'm sure we will both have a lovely stay with you and enjoy the celebrations. 
Thank you 
Hannah Vaughan

You can also take public transit which is less expensive at $2.50, however it requires a transfer as well as a ten minute walk, which may be uncomfortable depending on how much luggage you have. You would take the #80 from the Airport and connect to the #70 in Sidney, travel into downtown Victoria and then get off  at Douglas at Bellville and walk the rest of the way. The best way to find times is by following directions on BC Transit's website: http://www.busonline.ca/regions/vic/tripplanner.cfm

hi I am looking to book a roomfor 2 with a view for 1 night on July 1st

A cot would not fit into a room with two beds

User:
Ok do you know when that date will close out, so that I can have a few days to decide

User:
Ok thanks

Agent:
Good Morning, sorry for the delay in response. This chat feature was newly installed a few days ago. Unfortunately we are currently sold out for July 1st. If you are interested, we can place you on our waitlist and contact you if we receive any cancellations. Let me know. Thanks!

User:
Is there any room with 2 queens which would fit a cot and it's less than 350$? I only need to pickup my parents and their friends

Agent:
I'm not sure. It's hard to say because it depends on the number of rooms that are sold. The closer to being sold out the government rate becomes closed out. You can always book it and then cancel it before the cancellation policy (24 hours prior to arrival, before 4pm to modify/cancel reservation)

=====

I have made the booking. Would I be receiving a separate email about the 50 credit?

hi do you guys have private rooms for 15 in your restaurant?

User:
It's reasonable that you have to do construction, but a heads-up at check-in that it would be starting right outside the room at 8:00 am would have been good at check-in. If there were any empty rooms available, one not immediately beside the construction would have been even better. Other than that, it's been a good stay!

I do apologize. While we have a letter posted on the Front Desk as well as in each room, they are supposed to inform us prior to working on our street so that we are able to inform our guests at check in. Sadly, they did not. I am sorry to say that we were just as uninformed until the time they started their work. We have taken this up with the Chief Engineer of the project as well as the damage they have caused to our driveway. I am so sorry that they have taken away from your experience with us. Though I am happy that you were able to enjoy your stay despite them.

Confirmation No. 46844918
Room No. 1410

Hi!

I stayed in your hotel from June 15 until June 23, 2017. Upon check-in a deposit of US$100 was temporarily taken out from my Citibank credit card. I did not incur any expense or charges during my stay in your hotel. It has been eight (8) days since I checked out, and the $100 hasn't been returned or remitted back to my Citibank credit card account. This is very unfair to hold on to my funds, as I never incurred any charges during our stay.

Please return the US$100 to my account immediately.

Thank you.

Ms. Weena Tan

Hi Pat, thank you for your message. I apologize for the confusion; hopefully I can help. We've just recently changed our policies regarding advance purchase bookings, to make them more flexible. Used to be, once the booking was made, payment was taken immediately, and there would be no changes or cancellations permitted. As you've made your reservation after the change, it's better for you. We do still take payment right away, but you are permitted to cancel your booking, up until 24 hours before your arrival date. If you do need to cancel, the deposit is refunded to you, with no additional penalty. Again, I do apologize that we weren't clear. Please feel free to contact us at any time if you have any other questions or concerns.

Agent:
Thank you. May I please have the exoiration date?

Thank you for your question. Beacon Hotel South Beach is located right on the famous Ocean Drive where parking can be difficult. We offer 24-hour valet parking for $25/night with unlimited in-and-out service. There are also a couple of options for self-parking: public parking garages can be located just two blocks away on Collins Ave and 7th street. There's also meter parking available along Ocean Drive, Collins, and Washington Avenue, but spots are in high demand. Mostly, you will find it's more convenient to valet your car, especially if you stay in South Beach during weekend. Please let me know if you have further questions

User:
Is there a One bedroom available from 8 to 10 or only the 2 bedrooms?

User:
Ah ok

Yes, sorry about that. August is a very popular time.

At least you can save some money on the second apartment, as it fits your requirements better!

Hello, I stayed in room 328 Friday night June 29 and left something in my room

Agent:
Dear Guest, thank you for your Kind message. Could you provide us with your E-Mail adress so that we can send you all Information? Kind regards

Agent:
Dear Sir or Madam
Thank you for your kind request. We would be more than happy to offer Mrs Salles a room at the Baur au Lac for the requested dates.
But kindly be informed that our rooms are unfortunately not wheelchair accessible. Some rooms are, but the bathrooms are mostly complicated to turn around.
A transfer would be possible to arrange if Mrs Salles is able to stand up and enter the car by herself.
Kind regards

Sorry  no - the twin bedding is 2 single beds (90x200)

Sorry I meant the room size for twin beds and double bed in Brilliant.

Agent:
Brilliant twin or double bed are within the same size

User:
I see. Because you mentioned room size app 16-19m. So I thought maybe the room size is different between twin beds and double one.

Is that possible for you to offer a price lower than DKK4520 for wonderful twin beds room ?

Agent:
sorry - the 4520 DKK is our best offer - 20% discount when booking min 3 nights. Refundable rate.
