User: CAD
User: It's our anniversary this day.
User: 24 yrs, on the 24th, the Golden one
Agent: Oh congratulations!
Agent: I'm just taking a look at our website to check the pricing
Agent: I do see we are selling our Garden Studios at $384 CAD + taxes, but the One Bedroom Suites are at $444 CAD + taxes
Agent: The One Bedroom Suite has a king bed in the bedroom, and a separate living room. The Studio has the king bed and sitting area all in the one room
User: Oh, I specifically want the nice room with a decent deck overlooking the inner harbor side, is this that?
Agent: The One Bedroom Suites with a king bed have a partial water view. Let me see what else we have available that has a good view
User: ok
Agent: We do have a One Bedroom Suite with one queen bed (same layout of room) on a high floor with an inner harbour view at the same price
User: We're both tall, sorry we need a king.
Agent: Ok, then I might suggest the Studios, as they have a better view than the One Bedrooms. They do still have the balcony with the furniture, and the four piece marble bathrooms
User: Hold on, I'll look online.
Agent: They are the ones available at $384 CAD + taxes
User: I want it to be special, so a larger deck with king is my desire, very nice bathroom in the studio thought.
User: Bedroom suite have a king bed?
Agent: Yes, we do have the One Bedroom Suite with a king bed, which is currently what you are reserved in. They only have a partial view of the water though. You can see the water from the balcony, just not from the room itself
User: The one in the picture online looks like the deck is like 500 Sq. Ft. is that true?
User: Also what floor is the room I have booked, a higher one is preferred.
Agent: The suite is about 550 sq feet all together. The balcony is about 150 sq ft
Agent: These suites are anywhere from the 2-4th floor. I'll note your request for a high floor
User: Can the Empress be seen from inside the room?
Agent: No unfortunately not
User: Which direction of the compass is the room facing? I want to see the city at night from the room.
User: & yes the Empress, what room do I need for this?
User: Have I wore out my welcome?
Agent: Sorry, I was just on the phone with a guest
User: I have to leave soon & want to get this final. Thanks
Agent: Your best option for a view of the Empress would be an Erickson Wing Studio. We cannot guarantee it, but this would be your best choice for view of the Empress
User: Should I move to the executive suite to achieve my desire?
User: Does that room have a king?
Agent: Yes, that would be the best view of the City, as you are on the 5th floor with a view of the Inner Harbour
Agent: The Executive does have a king bed
Agent: The Executive Suite is about 800 sq feet in size just to give you an idea
User: Any cheaper options that fit my need?
Agent: And the balcony is about 200 sq feet
User: What's my best rate for the Executive?
Agent: The Executive is selling at $764 CAD + taxes, and we have AAA or Seniors discounts available
User: We're 56(;}
Agent: Ok! Well you do qualify, and that would bring the rate down to $687 CAD + taxes
User: Oh come on, we're ole buddies at this point, through me a bone, a oncve in a lifetime Golden anniversary.
Agent: I know, but unfortunately the Executive is one of our Specialty Suites, and that is the best discount we have
User: Am I gonna have to sweep up to get the best rate?
User: Regardless, let's change my reservation.
User: I'm feeling executive.
User: can you send a confirmation to bcampbell@surgentinc.com
Agent: Yes I will send it to you shortly. You are now confirmed in the Executive Suite
User: WooHoo

User: Is $210 the best rate available?
Agent: Hi there! There is at least one free walking tour in Copenhagen that starts at Rådhuspladsen (Town Square / City Hall) which is right in the middle of town and quite close to the hotel. 

This is the most comprehensive of the tours they offer and also the only one before noon - However, these tours go from 10, 11 and 12 AM and last 3 hours, which means you would have to take the one at 10 and then cut it short around 11:30 to be back at the hotel on time for the Wednesday, but on Tuesday you could take any of the three. 

They also offer a daily tour of Christiania from 4 PM, and a 'Classical' Tour of Copenhagen daily from 12 noon, these two tours start from Højbro Plads which is very close the the Town Hall

Hope that is of some help :)

Agent: Wonderful thank you. Unfortunately the group rate is no longer available, but I do have a Bedroom suite available. This as I said would have a pull out couch in the living room and one king sized bed in the bedroom. The nightly rate for 3 adults would be $469.00 CAN plus taxes and fees.

Agent: Good morning to you sir
Agent: Hello, thank you for reaching us. How may I help you?
Agent: Good Morning, Thanks for reaching out, We do offer connecting rooms at the hotel.  To accommodate your family I would suggest a Signature King connecting to a Signature Double (2 beds).  Just give me one moment and I can provide a quote for you.  My name is Jill if I can have your name as well!
User: hello to person?
User: Im looking for room for my boss
Agent: Hi, did you make a non refundable  booking? its only non refundable bookings that require prepayment.
Agent: Hi, our parking lot is really big and is surface parking. We always recommend guest never leave valuable belongs in their vehicles. We have surveillance for the parking lot as well as security that checks the parking lot.
Agent: We are 7 km from the hotel
Agent: How may I assist you, please let me know
User: we are looking to stay from 27th July to 1st Aug, could you tell me the best rate?
User: My name is Heidi
Agent: Hi there, please give me a moment to check our system for you
User: can i know do you provide payment term
User: Hi, my booking is refundable

Newuser: Thanks for the info!
User: We are group of 5 and looking for hotel rooms from 24 to 28 Dec, what is the best room rates that your hotel offes?
Agent: Hello, our standard rooms are already sold out for those dates. We only have Gold Junior Suite King room at the best rate of $249/night excluding taxes and resort fees.
Agent: Hello Heidi, for the requested dates in July for connecting rooms I have a Signature King Accessible (this room does not have a bathtub), that connects to a Loden Double.   At this time I am sold out of the connecting standard rooms.  The Signature King Accessible is $559CAD + taxes per evening and the Loden Double is $589CAD + taxes per evening.  All of our rooms come with complimentary wifi for unlimited devices, as well as use of our Loden Cab for drop off within the downtown core and use of our cruiser bicycles to explore nearby Stanley.    We also have packages available that include parking or breakfast included.  Let me know if there is other information I can provide.
User: thank you
User: for company
Agent: Perfect - no prepayment is required. We have no additional charges, however we have credit card fee if you choose to pay with Amex
Agent: My pleasure!
Agent: The hotel will be closed for Christmas
Agent: If you are comfortable being on the same floor but do not need connecting rooms than a Signature Corner King would be available also at $589CAD + taxes per evening
Agent: For May 8, 2018, we do have rooms available. It's currently a better value to reserve a 'room only' booking, and purchase breakfast separately. The best room-only rate for a Deluxe King room would be $245.40 CDN before tax, under our 'Early Bird' promotion. The cruise terminal is in downtown Vancouver; unfortunately we do not have a shuttle running that far. I'm not certain what taxi fare would be, but the ride is I believe about 30 minutes on average. I would recommend speaking with our hotel concierge for more detailed info and suggestions for transportation over to the port.
User: do you accept LOU for reservation
User: I see, thanks a lot for the information! We will be making payment either via cash or Mastercard. Have a great day! :)
User: Oh thanks for letting us know. we will look for other options then.

User: I hope you go bankrupt. Thank you!
Agent: Hi Henning, reservationen var jo lavet som jeg lovede. Jeg havde sendt bekræftelsen på email til din mail henning@fjoes.net. Det kunne jo være at den havde landet i papirkurven... og igen vil jeg huske dig på at det faktisk er mennesker som sidder har på den anden side af skærmen og derfor er det intet galt ved at skrive pænt. SKulle du have nogle problemer er du velkommen til at skrive direkte til mig på grm@andersen-hotel.dk. Jeg vil så tage mig af de klager som vi får, da jeg er Guest Relation manager her i huset. Mvh. Lára G. Lindgreen
User: Den reservasjonen kom aldri til min email. Jeg har ingen "papirkurv".  Jeg forstår ikke hva du mener med at skrive pænt.  Jeg har ikke gjort annet enn å beskrive helt saklig min opplevelse med å forsøke å booke hos dere. Når jeg beskriver dere som upofesjonelle er ikke det "stygt", der et korrekt. Jeh aldr noensinne vært i kontakt med mer uprofesjonelle folk enn dere. Til å starte med, burder dere kanskje være mer opptatt av å levere produktet deres enn å be folk om å snakke "pæmt".  Det er mennesker som sitter på andre siden også og vi setter ikke pris på å bli ignorert.

Uansett, jeg har booket på Skt Petri, så slutt på diskusjonen.
User: Jeg har sendt mine synspunkter med kopi av vår samtale til Karen Nedergaard.

Kontaktiram Vas ispred Udruženja za podsticanje preduzetništva "Živojin Mišić". 
Treću godinu za redom u okviru projekta "Najbolji edukatori" nagrađujemo Najbolje edukatore Srbije, više o projektu možete pogledati ovde. 

Ono što nam je potrebno jeste svečana sala za samu dodelu, koja bi se dogodila u drugoj polovini februara, kapaciteta od 120 do 180 mesta, kao i dve manje sale kapaciteta do 20, i do 40 mesta. 

Zanima me da li imate sale koje bi nama odgovarale, kao i da li je moguće zakazati sastanak kako bismo mi to videli do srede, najkasnije četvrtka?

Za sve dalje informacije, stojim Vam na raspolaganju. 

Srdačno,
User: Thanks for your help Tammy :) If your sales department can give me a quick response, we'd greatly appreciate it
User: anything less expensive which can accommodate 3 peple?
User: Moj mejl je ivona.jovanovic@zivojinmisic.rs pa Vas molim da mi na taj mejl pošaljete odgovor. Pozdrav,
Agent: I can't quote you rates since you are looking to book more than 10 rooms. I'll email your request to our sales department and someone from there will reach out to you soon.
Agent: Let me take a look for you.
Agent: Poštovana Ivona, na žalost naš hotel nema salu toliko veliku ali možemo da Vam ponudimo da Vaš događaj smestite u jugoslovensku kinoteku koja se nalazi odmah do nas, a da mi radimo ketering. Da li bi Vam ovakva opcija odgovarala?
User: The block we're working with needs to have rooms booked as soon as possible, so if your sales team can work up something quick, that'll be fantastic!
User: please
Agent: Ukoliko ste zainteresovani možda je najbolje da nastavimo prepisku putem mejla. Moja adresa je danijela.dzigurski@squarenine.rs
User: Thank you~
Agent: I have an Erickson Wing Studio with two queen beds available Aug.6 for 4nts or Aug.12 for 5nts. So you still get a balcony you can sit out on and the larger bathroom which is nice.
Agent: My pleasure!
Agent: Do you have AAA or would you qualify for a Seniors Rate?
Agent: Ooh and I have another great option in your preferred dates. We have an Inner Harbour Bedroom Suite that has a king size bed in the bedroom and a double size pull out sofa in the living room. It looks towards downtown Victoria. There isn't a picture on the website of this room unfortunately. There is a patio you can sit out on as well. It is located in our Laurel Wing but has the same larger bathroom as the Erickson Wing. I have that one available for Aug. 7 for 8 nights at an average rate of  $417+taxes per night.
User: so,there is not water view, correct?
Agent: Because we have the availability in the Inner Harbour Bedroom Suite for over 7 nights you would qualify for our weekly rate. So this room would be at an average rate of $354+taxes per night. Or about $267+taxes per night at today's US exchange rate.
Agent: Yes, this one has an inner harbour view and looks towards downtown.
User: I hope there is no outside nois
User: noise
Agent: It actually has a better view than the Bedroom Suites in the Erickson Wing truthfully.
User: husband is very sensitive
User: I c
Agent: No, we are away from the hustle and bustle of downtown.
User: will breakfast be included in this deal?
User: or I need to pay extra?
Agent: We don't have breakfast included in our weekly rate so it would be additional.
User: how much may I ask?
Agent: To add on breakfast it would be $21.50+15%gratuity +5% taxes so about $25.96 including grat and tax per adult each day. You would have a choice from 3 entrees in our restaurant plus coffee or tea plus juice. The choices are Point Breakfast (eggs & meat), continental or eggs benny.

Agent: Hello
Agent: You're welcome.
User: Thanks, that's all
Agent: Though we do not have our own shuttle, there is a company called YYJ Airporter Shuttle http://www.yyjairportshuttle.com/ which provides service between the airport and the hotels downtown, including ours.  The kiosk is located near the arrivals gate and you do not need reservations for pick-up as they are there whenever flights are departing or arriving. The cost is $25 per person each way, and to compare, the cost of a cab is approximately $60 one way. 

You can also take public transit which is less expensive at $2.50, however it requires a transfer as well as a ten minute walk, which may be uncomfortable depending on how much luggage you have. You would take the #80 from the Airport and connect to the #70 in Sidney, travel into downtown Victoria and then get off  at Douglas at Bellville and walk the rest of the way. The best way to find times is by following directions on BC Transit's website: http://www.busonline.ca/regions/vic/tripplanner.cfm

Please let me know if you have any questions or if I can be of further assistance

User: It is July 10 here--sorry.
Agent: Greetings from Impiana KLCC Hotel. Yes, it is.
User: thanks
Agent: For sure
User: Do we get 30% off because we are residents?
Agent: How may I assist you?
Agent: no there is no extra cost
User: Is that per room per night? Or the  total  for the two rooms together per night?thanks forgetting back to me.
User: What is the cost of this mistake?
Agent: Thank you for your inquiry & have a good day ahead.
Agent: Good news, parking is included!
Agent: Correct
Agent: Please let me know
User: We would be departing 16th so just the two nights 14 and 15th
Agent: Hi Janie, No problem at all. 
We do always charge for the first night. As you should have stayed at the hotel for one night, we did charge 1550 DKK,- from the credit card you provided when you booked the room at booking.com
User: wonderful!  do I park and register somewhere?
Agent: and i will add that on to your reservation right now
User: So is it 30% less than 231.00?
Agent: Hey there, yes that is per room per night. Hope you have a nice night.
Agent: You have to cancel the room the day before arrival before 4pm. Would you like me to sent the invoice to you?

Newuser: My daughter, Mhairi Nicolson,  has booked a terrace suite for Wednesday, June 14 and June 15th. Could you please tell me if there is a CD player in the room?
Agent: If you know your license plate number off hand, I can pre-register it for you, then you can just park anywhere, and head to your event
Agent: is there anything else i can do for you ?
Agent: $231.00 is the discounted rate
User: Thank you. Can I reserve overnight and confirm for definite in the morning? Thank you
User: I understand the one night charge but that is more than 1/4 of my original booking amount?
Agent: Good Morning! I have just asked the front desk and they are going to check to see if there is one in room.
Agent: Or, you can stop by the front desk and give them the plate number, that would work as well
User: Thank you so much.  Could I request a single king?
User: Ok thanks!
Agent: Hey there, we do not reserve rooms unfortunately, In my professional opinion though i think they will still be there by the time you call.
Agent: I am sorry, i did wrote the wrong amount. The first night price was 1350 DKK,- so we did charge 1350 DKK,- 
The next 3 nights is 1550 DKK,- each so in total for the whole stay it should have been 6000 DKK,- Would you like the invoice sent to your email where you can see the amount we charged your credit card for the first night?
User: thanks, also is there a kettle for tea? I read there was a coffee/tea maker, however, I'm as fussy tea person who doesn't like tea made from a coffee machine?
User: DF575X
Agent: I can definitely put in the request for you, however I can not guarantee it.
Agent: You're very welcome!
User: Ok I will call first thing tomorrow thankyou
User: Ok.  Is there anyway to apply that charge to a new booking instead?
Agent: I feel the same way! There is a drip coffee machine and a kettle in the room :)
User: Thank you thats great
User: That's fine.  I also have a reservation 58534403 from the 23-27...could I add a request for both to that one as well?

Newuser: hello
Agent: Sounds goood
Agent: You have to contact booking.com and ask them, as you booked through them. We hope to see you another time.
User: kettle is great. Mhairi also requested the terrace room on the highest floor for the terrace rooms. Do you know if that's the one she'll be in? third or fourth floor, something like that. She's my daughter and is 'eloping' with family present. They will be married on the terrace. She's been working with Ashley Haddow, however, I didn't know if Ashley worked today, so I'm chatting with you. My husband and I are heading to Victoria tomorrow and I just need to know if we should bring a CD player.
Agent: Ok, I have registered your license plate. When you arrive, just park in any available space, and enjoy your evening! I can send you an email confirmation of your parking registration if you like?
User: Please and thank you
Agent: Hello, thank you for reaching us. How may I help you?

Newuser: Hi, I did not receive my cancellation confirmation or cancellation invoice. I spoke to booking.com and they told  me that the cancellation charge is at your discretion.  Any flexibility?  My mistake but hoping you can help.

User: Rate?
Agent: Regards,
User: Good Morning
Agent: goo day
User: my name is Stavros Kontos

Newuser: Hello, good day
Agent: Oh, this may because you've checked a special rate such as government,etc.
Agent: For the basic shower room, it is $99. Unfortunately it's all we have left. It's a standing shower bathroom and very small rooms. They are definitely the most economical rooms we have, but are not up to the quality standard as the rest of our rooms.
Agent: Unfortunately we do not have a shuttle service at the hotel. 
You can take the train from the airports station to Copenhagen Central Station, that takes around 20 minutes, and then the hotel is located 5 minutes of walking from the Central Station. Price for train is 38 DKK,- for adults and half for children.
You can also take a taxi outside all terminals at the airport towards the hotel, the price will be around 200-275 DKK,- it depends on the traffic.
User: i would like to inquire about availability and possible best offer
Agent: Good Afternoon, at this time we are fully booked on the nights of August 11th and 12th. Please let me know if there are any alternative dates I can check availability for.
Agent: Hello
Agent: Please show us how you got to the page and we are happy to check in our system for you.
User: hmmm
Agent: our bellmans can store your bags for you
User: Thank you, very useful information. How far is the hotel from the cruise terminal, oceankaj? is taxi the best way to get there?
User: for April 28th - May 1st
Agent: Warm Regards, - Taynar
Agent: How may I help you?
User: Oh I had just googled the hotel and clicked on the first web address that can up. But I see it is gc.synix.com
Agent: We don't usually rent these out unless we absolutely have to. If you're just planning to sleep there and not stay in your room very much, then it's great. If you're planning on relaxing and spending time in the room, then I would not recommend it.

Newuser: Hi team. I would like to ask, actually i am having meeting at klcc and i am planning to book for 3 night. But i would like the invoice to petronas.
Agent: You can take all the train from Oceankaj to Central Station of Copenhagen. Depends which train you are taking, it will be 2-4 stops. 
Some cruises is really close to the train station, and others are not close to the station and you have to walk for 10 minutes with your luggage. So it depends how close you are from the cruiseship to the station as Oceankey is really long.
User: for 8 rooms
User: good morning!
Agent: I see. It seemed like that may be in error on our end if you are not searching for the government rate. On July 28th for 1 night We do have deluxe room with 2 queen beds at $239.40 CAD plus tax per night per room.
User: That is a very honest answer.
User: My room rate is max is 350 per night so i eligible for deluxe and superior room only
User: 6 simple 1 bedroom
Agent: Taxi is around 175-250 DKK,- from Oceankaj.
Agent: Good morning!
User: Does this include parking?
Agent: We have some people who love it and some people who hate it. It just depends on what you're looking for.
User: But if i took the club bonus package the total is still the same for 3 night since i got one free night
User: suppose what you call superior king
User: Thanks, I will be going from the hotel to cruise terminal, so I guess taxi will be the best option, around 200 DKK
User: i'd need your help:I am contacting you from Mastercard.
My name is Francesca, and I am supporting a group of representatives of our management meeting in NY next July 10th to 13th .
Agent: Do you require long term parking or just for the one night?
User: Well, it's for move-in day.
User: Can we adjust the invoice so that the total expenses is for 3 days?
User: 2 suites
Agent: it can be more than 200 DKK,- it depends on the traffic :)
User: I know we have a MC preferred rate with your hotel, and would like to ask you if it would be possible to hold 6 rooms for us, for the above dates.
User: Just one night
User: what size bed?
User: Hope to hear from team soon. Thanks
User: and 2 suites
User: Thanks very much

User: thnx. I am interested in a reservation from May 31 for 3 nights depart on June 3. I need 3 rooms.

Agent: just check it out....
User: here's the questions: what are the dimensions of the "wonderful room" and the junior suite

Agent: Do you prefer the prepaid rate or the flexible?
User: yes thank you so much
User: also I am confused about the rates.  I need to be able to cancel. What is the difference between "unwind" and Speicial rate"
User: Thanks. If we wanted to upgrade to a full balcony what approx would be the added cost?
Agent: I will need your name and email address
User: do you know which area the one bedroom villa is in?
User: Hello?
Agent: Usually at this time of the year, the upgrade fee would be $100 from a Laurel Wing Guestroom to an Erickson Wing Studio

Agent: May I have your name, please?
User: Tel. 044 980 1826

Agent: Good Day! Lisa just left for her break. I'll be assisting you with your questions.

Newuser: Hi, we are staying tomorrow. Do we get access to the ski lodge bar for a drink? Or does that need booking separately?
Agent: Oct 8th $149.40 is a deluxe king bed
Agent: The Ski lodge needs to be reserved in advance, how many people are you looking for?
Agent: Two consecutive nights?
User: Just 2 of us. Was only looking to have a drink or two?
Agent: Sorry I'm a bit confused.
Agent: A pass on to the ski lodge is £30 per person and you have 3 drinks and a platter of food included in the pass.

Newuser: no  stay on each end of our trip
User: Thanks anyway but eating out already. See you tomorrow.
User: Stay September 14 and Oct 8.  Need parking between these dates
Agent: See you tomorrow
Agent: I understand now. I counted 26 nights including in total. Is that correct on your end?
Agent: 4 extra nights of parking is $5 per night.
User: I get 25 nights Sept 14 arrival - depart Oct 9.
User: two of these nights we are staying in the hotel.
User: so those nights should be covered by room rate - correct?
Agent: The parking package up to 22 nights of parking includes the night your arrive to park the car. Any additional parking after 22 nights is $5 per night.
User: Ok.  would the parking not be included in the accomodation on Oct 8th. ?
User: Package would provide parking up to and including night of Oct 5, additional parking of $5 for Oct 6 & 7 and then parking Oct 8 covered by accommodation Oct 8.  I believe that is what Lisa R quoted above.
User: Lisa R quoted above:
User: On Sep 14th based on double occupancy we have a deluxe king at $272 CAD plus tax which includes the 1 night stay on 14th and 22 nights of parking. The extra 2 nights of parking will be $5 CAD plus tax per night. On Oct 8 staying for the 1 night I have $149.40 CAD plus tax.
Agent: No, because the parking package only covers up to 22 nights starting from Sept 14 therefore, parking is covered up to Oct. 5 anything after is $5 extra per night.
User: We will think about this
Agent: If you don't mind. I'll have to speak with Lisa on what she had told you because I scrolled up the message chat and only see "On Sep 14th based on double occupancy we have a deluxe king at $272 CAD plus tax which includes the 1 night stay on 14th and 22 nights of parking. The extra 2 nights of parking will be $5 CAD plus tax per night. On Oct 8 staying for the 1 night I have $149.40 CAD plus tax."
Agent: Did you still want us to email you the details?
User: yes please email.  based on Lisa quote the parking for Oct 8 is included in hte room rate for that night
Agent: Okay. Will do.

Newuser: Dear Sir or Madam,
 
today i booked a room from September 20th to September 21st in your hotel.
Now i have a few questions.

I have read that you offer a free shuttle service.
Is this only from the hotel to the airport, or also from the airport (when we arrive) to the hotel?
If so, where do we find this shuttleservice at the airport and at what times does this? Do we have to register?
Our plane lands on 20.9. at 10.55am, until we have our luggage and get out, it will be about 11.30am.
 
Is it possible to get a room on the top floor, with great views of the harbor?
 
Is on 20.9. Evening the Richmond Night market?
 
We have to pick up our camper on 21.9.
The address is: Cruise Canada RV Rental & Sales, 7731 Vantage Way, Delta, BC V4G 1A6, Canada.
Can you tell me which connection to the public transport is available, or how much is a taxi from your hotel to the rental station?
 
I am looking forward to your reply,
and many greets from Germany,
Coinna Gruber

User: Hi,

I stayed in the hotel from the 17th to 19th April, and bought a ticket for the Tivoli from reception on the 17th, at 17.10. I was in Copenhagen on a business trip, so I asked the receptionist to charge my ticket to my personal debit card, and he did so, and money was taken from my personal card. However, the same amount of money was taken out of my work credit card at the end of my stay when I paid for the room. 

Therefore, I paid for 2 tickets to the Tivoli, one on my personal bank account and one with my work bank account, and was only given one ticket.

I would like a refund for one ticket please.

Thank you,
Anisha Lakhani

Newuser: Good morning
Agent: Hi,

Agent: Hello, yes of course I can assist you with that, could you share the dates with me.

Newuser: Great.  Would that be a "Cool Double Room"?
Agent: Do you have any dates in particular I could assist with?
Agent: Thank you for your question. Beacon Hotel South Beach is located right on the famous Ocean Drive where parking can be difficult. We offer 24-hour valet parking for $25/night with unlimited in-and-out service. There are also a couple of options for self-parking: public parking garages can be located just two blocks away on Collins Ave and 7th street. There's also meter parking available along Ocean Drive, Collins, and Washington Avenue, but spots are in high demand. Mostly, you will find it's more convenient to valet your car, especially if you stay in South Beach during weekend. Should you have any other questions please do not hesitate to contact us.

Agent: Hello!
User: I was looking to make reservations for the following dates Aug 4th Thru the 6th.
Agent: Hello! 
Sorry that our site is giving you trouble, is it providing you with any kind of error message?
User: Did I mention we went to Victoria for our honeymoon?  :-)
Agent: สวัสดีครับ ขอประทานโทษที่ตอบช้านะครับ
User: Ann Sterman - We are leaving on the 16th, so that won't work.  We have stayed there in the past and loved it.  Any suggestions for this very last minute trip?
User: no just not giving mre the dates even tho they show availability
User: Looking at spicing up marriage so the naughty package and then the butchart garden. I wondered with the butchart gardens about transportation to gardens?
Agent: ช่วงดังกล่าว เราจะมีราคาโปรโมชั่น สำหรับ ห้อง Deluxe private pool suite 9,999 บาทต่อคืน ครับ
Agent: Thank you so much for your feedback Ms. Sterman! I am happy to place the booking on the waitlist if you'd like should anything become available we would be reaching out. If you are looking for a property close in proximity to the Loden the closest hotels would be the Hyatt Regency and Coast Coal Harbour
User: would appreciate your help.
User: How can I book?
Agent: We can definitely arrange both of these packages for you - Currently we do have very limited availability over your dates. Let me just take a look and see what we can do for you
User: We're looking for a small beautiful hotel like your (as close as it can be like yours)
User: do you have a room for those dates?
Agent: Transportation out to the gardens is not included in the package, you would need to take the local bus, a taxi or you can book a shuttle service through CVS tours.
Agent: Dear Mrs Castro, thank you for your kind message. Could you provide us with the voucher number?
Agent: Certainly. In terms of boutique style properties I believe the Wedgewood is located in the area, though not the same feel as the Loden it would be similar in terms of size boutique feel.
Agent: I will just have a quick look and see, otherwise you are welcome to try and book through Booking.com, otherwise I will have to direct you to our Booking department which can be contacted at +45 3331 4344 / booking@andersen-hotel.dk, however they are not available right now, but they are open from 9:00 AM (GMT+1)
User: Great thanks. Even if it is a couple of those  dates at front or end of our stay we can always  do other accomodations
User: 336567
User: they do not have availability
User: ok thank you for the info on the gardens
Agent: Dear Mrs Castro, yes that would be possible. May we kindly ask you to send us all your Details to following e-maill adress: Reservation@bauraulac.ch
Agent: I am sorry to hear that Ms. Sterman, this is a very busy time in the city. My suggestion would therefore be to try looking on Tripadvisor or Expedia which properties would have availability for these dates.
User: we do have alternative dates possible of August 7 &8th
User: How exciting.  Thank you. 
 Absolutely will do.
Agent: Please let me know if I can provide any further assistance!
Agent: We can accommodate you for the full duration in one of our Erickson Wing Studio rooms with 1 king bed. With the Butchart Gardens package the nightly rate would be $428.30 on average, plus taxes and fees. This would include breakfast each day, your entry to the gardens and complimentary parking (if needed).
User: Thank you for your help.
Agent: Kind Regards,
Agent: To add on the naughty package, it would be an additional $125 plus taxes
Agent: Thank you and looking Forward to welcome you soon.

Newuser: Hello! When is check in?
Agent: The quoted rates are in Canadian Dollars
Agent: Hello there
User: Oh that makes some sense what is the cost in US? and I do not see the Erickson Wing Studio on your website?
Agent: Our check in time is guaranteed for 4 pm
Agent: http://laurelpoint.com/studios/
User: Is it possible to check in earlier?
Agent: Approximate nightly rate is $322.64 USD, and the naughty package would be about $94 USD
Agent: I can note on your reservation that you expect to arrive early. If there is a room ready for you when you arrive, you are welcome to check in early, however this is not guaranteed. If it is not ready early, you can certainly store your luggage with us in the meantime.
User: Great thanks
Agent: What is your reservation booked under?
User: Ok let think on this a few min. will be back in a few minutes.
User: Tsang, Amy
Agent: You're welcome!
User: My ferry gets in around noon so I just wanted to ask.
User: Is this with taxes included?
Agent: Great! I have noted down your early check in request!
Agent: The rates quoted are not including tax
User: Oh thank you!
User: ok  is there any better rate I don't mean to be miserly but I see the same room on a hotel discount site of 287 US . If I get that room can I add the romance part?

Newuser: Hi I have question about booking a studio king suite under package from june 23 -25. I tried to book it but there is no studio king suite available and it is only available without package.
User: How much are taxes?
Agent: Hi there
User: Do you have the naughty romance package available Monday August 7th?
Agent: What package were you looking to book?
Agent: I believe the rate you are viewing would be just the room, not including the Butchart Gardens package, which I have included in the quote and then also quoted you to add on the extras from the naughty package. We can certainly book in just the room, and then add on the package however this would only give you breakfast for one day, if you wanted breakfast daily we would need to look at package pricing.
User: I am thinking either rockstar package or nice romance
Agent: Rates also do fluctuate daily so depending on which days you are looking at, the rates could be different.
Agent: Sure! A Studio for June 23rd for 2 nights on the Nice package is an average nightly rate of $469.83 CAN plus taxes and fees. Our RockStar Package is also available at the average nightly rate of $446.00 CAN plus taxes and fees.
Agent: Taxes are 17.16%
User: may i know the total price for rockstar  package in a studio king suite?
User: yes I am realizing this is a real industry now just getting a hotel :-) I miss the days of just making the reservation. :-)
Agent: Of course one moment
Agent: You can always make a reservation and change it later depending on availability. We just need 24 hours notice prior to check in for cancellations.
Agent: For a 2 night stay, June 23rd for 2 nights, the total after taxes is $1,021.36 CAN
User: Good to know. WE are actually there for a week so I am trying to figure a plan out. will have some dates shortly.  Can I make reservations through the website or shall I call?
User: thank you ! i will talk to my husband and make final decision. thanks!
Agent: Either or is fine, we can be reached toll-free at 1.800.663.7667
Agent: Wonderful! Have a great night!
User: Ok great thank you so much for your help!

Newuser: hi, i am wondering whether there is any studio king suite for reservation on june 23 to 25?
Agent: You are most welcome!
User: hi, i am wondering whether there is any studio king suite for reservation on june 23 to 25?

Newuser: I see there is a spa option and wonder if there are any couples massage?
User: is rockstar package include free valet packing?
Agent: We have Inn Room Spa Services but would require a date and time which you would like the massages to take place on in order to inquire with our mobile spa company if they are available.

Newuser: Is it possible to get a roll away bed in junior suite or one bedroom king suite?
Agent: They do offer couples massages, however not all rooms can accommodate both massage tables.
Agent: Unfortunately, a rollaway bed cannot be requested for those suites as it is against the fire safety policy
User: Great thanks that helps.
User: OK, thank you

Newuser: Ya! So What rooms are available for Monday August 7 and 8th for one day naughty romance and  instead of the Buchart gardens how does the 150 food tour work? Is that a package or separate?

User: do you offer any discount for two rooms?  And can they be connected rooms?
Agent: Hi the Erickson Wing Studios are certainly more luxurious and larger to celebrate a special occassion.  They have a large 4 piece Marble bathroom and a larger outside balcony with Patio furniture.

User: what currency is this?
Agent: Our Signature King room is available at the rate of $199CAD + taxes per evening.
Agent: Hello!
User: is  this 321.00 include taxes
Agent: Thank you for writing us. Our oceanfront king rooms are one of our more premium rooms in terms of amenities, space, size, and view.
User: i need 2 beds in one room
Agent: The hotel is located on Ocean Drive and the beach can be accessed by crossing Ocean Drive and you're right on the beach
Agent: The $321.00 rate is before tax. If you are interested in 2 beds, our Bedford Double is our only room with two double beds. All the other rooms have a queen bed.
Agent: We do provide complimentary beach amenities such as towels and chairs for your convenience and enjoyment
User: can you please advise the total cost for  8  nights
Agent: Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.
User: for the bedford I would like to book
User: Thank you for your feedback, are those the "perks" we get from booking direct with you? and is breakfast included?
User: what happened to the $270 per night
Agent: Absolutely they are. Breakfast is also included as is Wifi
User: i asked for the rate with taxes but the message has been taken off the board.It said I needed the Bedford room 5 aug to 13th aug. i will call the hotel if Ido not hear back. cheers Penny
Agent: Another perk you get for booking direct is priority check-in. While our standard check-in time is at 3pm, we give priority to those guests that booked directly with us
Agent: I'm sorry to inform you but our Bedford Double are all sold out from Aug 5th or Aug 13th. Is there any other dates we can accommodate? I can suggest booking two separate rooms if you like. The average nightly rate for the Grove Queen for that length stay is $290 USD but I could offer a 10% discount on the rate which comes out to $261.50 USD average per night. Because you are staying 3 night and longer, there is a 15% promotion rate discount which makes it $246.13 USD. If booked under this promotion, a full deposit of the stay has to be made and it is non-refundable. If you have any further questions, you can always call us directly for an immediate answer. Thank you.
Agent: Is there anything else I can assist with?
User: thankyou but that is $500USD or  $ 650 AUD. Y
User: not right now, thank you. I will share this with my husband so we can decide
Agent: Good Afternoon, the rates quoted are in US dollars.
Agent: Sounds great! Please feel free to contact us or visit our website for great prices and other rewards
User: i need to know taxes your website does not provide that
Agent: Hello, the taxes are 14.75% plus $3.50.

User: HI
Agent: No, of cause not.
User: A day rate sounds good. We are two adults and two children. We would need two queen size beds.
User: Just so I am clear, and the reason for my checking. The PROMO Rate for WRESORTS is showing 155 for a deluxe King. It seems it would be a better price to just get two rooms instead of a two room suite.

Agent: That is correct. The $155 rate is based on double occupancy but you mentioned there will be a 3rd adult in the room that is why the rate is $185
Agent: The only room we would have available would be a Laurel Wing Guestroom with 2 double beds and a view of the water at the rate of $271 before taxes and fees per night. That is our extended weekly rate since you would be staying 7 nights.
User: is there a code to put in...I know that I will have to present my id at checkin
User: Sleeps in bed with us

Newuser: Thank you. I will call later this afternoon.
Agent: Yes, you are also correct. The best value would be getting two rooms vs. a two bedroom suite.
User: Thank you very much would I be able to tentatively book this room.  The reason being is I had reservations at a different hotel (that I understand does not have air conditioning which we require) and I need to ensure I an cancel that reservation first.
Agent: Are you interested in July 6-7?
Agent: Yes and that is n o problem in a double bed room.
Agent: Perfect! We'll talk to you soon!

Agent: Hi again, I have noted your request on the reservation. Kindly note, it is subjected to availability upon arrival.
User: I was one of the passenger of Air canada that has veen cancelled the flight last tuesday. I was sent to your hotel to check in, they've asked my credit card just in case i got ovee with my bills. I've checked my credit card today and I was deducted $50.00 why is that so?
Agent: If you are flying into Miami International Airport, the easiest way to get to the hotel is to take a taxi. This is a flat fee of $35.
The hotel does not offer a shuttle.
There is no need to make advance reservations, just from the departures gate, there will be a queue of taxis outside. 
 All taxies that operate out of the airport are safe and fully bonded.
Please let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with.

Agent: Greetings from Impiana KLCC Hotel. The Ramadan buffet will be RM148 nett (Adults) & RM74 nett (Children).
Agent: It's likely that's the pre-authorization, rather than a finalized charge. Generally, all hotels will pre-authorize a certain amount for any potential incidentals which may be incurred during your stay. Any portion not spent toward incidentals (dining, movies, etc.) is released upon checkout. Normally, it should appear back on your statement within about 5-7 business days, depending on your card and issuing bank.
User: Thank You! :)

Agent: For reservations, please call +603-2147 1025 or email fnbrsvp.iklcc@impiana.com

Newuser: i did not add the room into card and saw a junior suite offer for total of 7000
User: now i cant book it cause it is not there - barely 10 minutes ago

User: sorry could you help see what went wrong? as the rate initially shown at 7000 is not showing up now
User: u there?
Agent: what date are you trying to book for?

User: i didnt  understand that i needed to add into cart
User: anyway pls let me know if you can do anything
User: i am waiting to confirm the room if you can help
User: u there?
Agent: 7000 DKK sounds like a very low price for a junior suite for 4 days... I think there must have been some kind of mistake
Agent: The rate is 10'380 DKK for all 4 nights, including breakfast and VAT
User: it was a non refundable and direct booking it said
User: anyway i guess you wont be able to do anything about it
Agent: The non refundable rate is 9342 DKK in my system
Agent: No, I can't change the rates unfortunately
User: how many suites do you have btw? i am intending to do a non refund but wanna ask my family but they are all sleeping now
User: in case i can confirm non refund tomorrow, can i still change to non refund if i book a free cancellation room today ?
Agent: There is still a couple of Junior Suites left for these days, so I don't think it will be a problem for you to book it tomorrow. 
Also I don't think it is possible to change from a refundable rate to a non refundable rate.

User: Yes, we are looking into Friday night, July 21st for one night.

Agent: Hello!
User: Okay. Thank you so much for your help!
Agent: You're welcome! If you have any other questions please let us know!
Agent: Age restriction is over 21 years old or accompanied by someone who is over 21
Agent: Is there anything I can assist with?
Agent: What a great trip! I will look into those dates for you, give me one moment.
User: can an exception be made for a person that is 19
User: Thank you! We are celebrating my husband's 40th birthday and our 18th wedding anniversary.
Agent: Unfortunately, for safety and security purposes, the guest must be 21 or accompanied by someone 21
Agent: Oh congratulations!
Agent: It's for liability purposes
Agent: We would love to be able to be apart of your celebration.
Agent: When we get you booked in, I will make sure to let our Guest Experience Manager know and I'm sure they will put together a nice little treat for you both.
Agent: The best rate I am seeing for July 21st is our Bed & Breakfast package which includes our continental buffet breakfast for two. This rate is $539 + tax for our Signature King room.
Agent: For July 23rd we have our Travel Wiser promotion running though! Which is $469 + tax.
User: Is that price CAD or USD?
Agent: This is in Canadian.
Agent: In USD, the 21st would be approximately $418 and July 23rd would be $361
Agent: Keeping in mind, the 21st rate I quoted is including breakfast whereas the Travel Wiser promotion on the 23rd does not include breakfast. I would be happy to let you know the breakfast package rate though if this is something you are interested in.
User: Sorry, couple more questions. Is the Friday night king signature room, a corner room? Also, do have shuttle services from the airport terminal to your hotel.
Agent: Not a problem, happy to answer any questions!
Agent: The Signature King room is not a corner room. Our corner rooms are an extra $30 per night.
Agent: The hotel does not offer a shuttle service from the airport, but we could certainly arrange for one for you if you would like.
User: What kind of view would be the room on the 21st?
Agent: These rooms offer a city view.
Agent: Our signature room is actually one of my favorite rooms as they have a nice sliding wall to the bathroom which opens up the space quite a bit. Although if you are looking for a view our Park Vista or Garden Terrace rooms would be a great option!
Agent: The Park Vista is a corner room offering a partial view of the water. This room is $60 more than the signature, so approximately $420 USD on the 21st. And then the Garden Terrace actually has a little step out patio that overlooks our urban oasis on the 2nd floor. It's a unique little green space with a running stream right outside your room. Very peaceful! The Garden Terrace rooms also include extra little amenities such as complimentary sauna sessions and yogi tea. These rooms are $100 more than the signature.
User: Park Vista is $420 USD on the 21st and the Signature King is $418? I know you mentioned it's $60 more, was that for the 23rd instead or does that take out the included breakfast ? Just to clarify- sorry
Agent: My apologies, the Park Vista on the 21st would be $460 USD.
Agent: I was looking at the rate on the 23rd. Sorry for the confusion.
User: Also I read about possible drop-off car services and bike services, would this be included in the hotel stay fee or is it an extra fee? Would the bikes be able to used for a couple of hours around Stanley park/Seawall?
Agent: Yes, these are both included for all hotel guests complimentary.
Agent: The seawall and Stanley Park are only minutes away so definitely a great bike ride.
User: Did Friday night's quote  included taxes and fees?
Agent: The rates quoted are before taxes.
Agent: I can give you an all in price. Are you considering the Park Vista room?
User: I would go with the Signature King room to help with some of the costs.
Agent: Okay, so including taxes and fees the Bed and Breakfast package on the 21st would come to $627/nt Canadian. Approximately $483 USD.
User: You have been super helpful and informative- thank you so much!
Agent: My pleasure!
User: I definitely would like to book  the room for Friday night with breakfast included.
Agent: Great!
Agent: Can I get your first and last name?
User: Erin Strong
Agent: Thank you Erin! And can I get your husband's name?
User: Jeff
User: same last name
Agent: Perfect.
Agent: Could I also get your email, phone and home address please?
User: Address: 4033 35th St. N.   Lake Elmo, MN (USA) 55042         Phone # (cell): (763) 443-3577    Email: astrongfamily@gmail.com
Agent: Thank you!
User: You're welcome
Agent: And then lastly I will just need your credit card to guarantee the reservation.
Agent: If you would prefer to offer this through the phone, I can give you a call to get the credit card number.
User: American Express ok?
Agent: Yes, of course!

Agent: Hello, if you are booking on our website we have a 24 hour cancellation policy
Agent: I am Alessandro
User: This was a junior suite in the Laurel Wing at the AAA rate. Does that mean within 24 hours of the arrival date?

Agent: The rate includes buffet breakfast, wifi, 25% Vat and complimentary glass of wine at the reception everyday from 5 to 6 pm!
User: Would the  summer deal offer lower rates?

User: Kiera Vasan
User: The rate I'd seen online a few minutes ago was something like $206/night--less than for a smaller guestroom, so I'd assumed it would be a special on the junior suite.
Agent: from May 14?
User: That may have been $206 USD
User: Yes May 14-17.  Entered my Visa credit card number (she has same card)
Agent: Yes, $206 USD comes to approximately $264 CAD
Agent: I dont see it in the system... Can you try again?
User: Are there any special offers in the Erickson Wing for those dates? It's just for me, and I qualify for both AAA and AARP rates, but I like a roomy room. And can one request a NO-pet room?

Agent: We do have the Erickson Wing Studios with a king bed available. They are about 450 square feet in size, and the AAA/AARP discount is $354 CAD/night + tax, which is about $275 USD/night
Agent: Not found
Agent: And you are able to request a no-pet room
User: Now do you see it?  confirmation 298789.
User: Thanks. I'll probably book the junior suite in the Laurel Wing then and request a no-pet room. Do all the rooms have good water views?
Agent: I can see it now :)
Agent: The Junior Suites have a partial water view. If you were wanting a room with a good view in the Laurel Wing, I would suggest the Inner Harbour guest rooms ($291 CAD/night) or the Sunset rooms ($300 CAD/night)

Newuser: Hi, do you offer an airport pick up?
Agent: Hi There
Agent: Though we do not have our own shuttle, there is a company called YYJ Airporter Shuttle http://www.yyjairportshuttle.com/ which provides service between the airport and the hotels downtown, including ours.  The kiosk is located near the arrivals gate and you do not need reservations for pick-up as they are there whenever flights are departing or arriving. The cost is $25 per person each way, and to compare, the cost of a cab is approximately $60 one way. 

You can also take public transit which is less expensive at $2.50, however it requires a transfer as well as a ten minute walk, which may be uncomfortable depending on how much luggage you have. You would take the #80 from the Airport and connect to the #70 in Sidney, travel into downtown Victoria and then get off  at Douglas at Bellville and walk the rest of the way. The best way to find times is by following directions on BC Transit's website: http://www.busonline.ca/regions/vic/tripplanner.cfm
User: Thank you very much, that's very helpful
Agent: You are very welcome! Please let me know if I can help any further!

We would like to arrange an airport pickup and drop off with the hotel as well but the flights are not on sale yet so we do not have our flight details at the moment. Is it possible to arrange the airport pickup and drop off after booking our room when we have the details?
User: Good day to you
Agent: The only difference is in the fact that one option is to prepay the room with no possibility to change or cancel the reservation (i.e Room Only) and the other option is that you can pay when you check out,change or cancel the reservation without any extra fees (ie. Unwind package)
User: I think your website could make that clearer

Agent: So I'm looking at June 26th and unfortunately you are correct. We are fully sold out on this date.

Newuser: A couple looking for accommodation from 02/09/2017, out 15/09/2017.  What do you have available please?  We are part of the Kreutzberger/Blackwell/Whitehead group.
Agent: Ok, we are sold out of our Laurel Wing guest rooms with 2 beds. We do have our Erickson Wing Studios available with 2 queen beds, a large balcony with furniture overlooking the water. The AAA discount is $354 CAD/night + taxes and fees

Agent: to check for prices please choose the check in and check out date, then choose availability, the rates will be displayed
User: I see a 2 queen studio in Erickson wing on website for $274 per night with AAA.  Is that still available and does it have water views?
User: ok i will do that
Agent: Sorry, June 24th I meant.
Agent: We are also running a special promotion as follows: http://spps.pphotels.com/promotions/freenights/
Agent: I believe that would be in US dollars, as $274 USD = $354 CAD currently
User: thank you
User: No flexibility on our end - sorry.
Agent: You're welcome.
Agent: Sorry to hear that.
User: I see online a queen studio in E wing or the Sunset room in L wing.  Is there any significant difference in the views
Agent: Let me take a look at that address and see if there's any hotels i can recommend.
Agent: The Sunset rooms have an outer harbour view (facing away from downtown). The Studios have either an inner or an outer harbour view depending on what side of the building you are on.
User: You are a rock star - thanks!
Agent: And just so you are aware, the Sunset rooms have a king bed and a double sized pullout couch
Agent: My pleasure!
User: yes, I saw the pull out info.  Do you have a recommendation one over the other for views/location
Agent: The two closest hotels would be Hotel Blu and the Opus Hotel.
Agent: They both have great views. The only difference between the two is the bathroom - the Erickson Wing have the marble bathroom with a soaker tub. The Sunset room has a regular bathroom with a combination tub and shower
User: We would love to use your hotel in the future.  Thanks for the advice.  Cheers!
User: Can I or should I  request inner or outer harbor view when booking?  Recommendation for family with young kids?
Agent: Both are boutique style but in Yaletown which is a bit more of a lively part of town.
Agent: Yes, you can certainly request either view. My recommendation would be the outer harbour view, as this is where the seaplanes land, and the harbour taxis go by as well
Agent: Happy to help!
User: excellent- the kids would love to see all that activity; thank you
Agent: All the best and we hope to have you or your company stay with us in the future!
Agent: You're welcome!
Agent: Do you have regular travel into Vancouver?
User: thank you for all the info; booking now; have a lovely day
User: We do and we hope to utilize your hotel.  Thanks again.  Make it a great day!
User: just looking at some additional info on breakfast packages and whale watching;  breakfast is huge with this crew :)
Agent: Great! Just before you head out, I will highlight that we can offer corporate negotiated rates based on how often your company travels into Vancouver.
Agent: Sorry, I just stepped away from my desk. The breakfast options in our packages is a choice of 3 entrees in our Aura Restaurant: Eggs Benny, Point Breakfast (meat and egg option), or Continental. Breakfast is included for adults, children would be at an additional price
Agent: I would be happy to put you in touch with our sales team if you are interested in seeing what rates we can offer you on a yearly basis.
User: If I booked the 2 queen studio for $354 what would be the additional fee for breakfast or is there a breakfast included package that might be better for us?
User: Would you send me some information: anita.wolf@elliebianca.com
Agent: Yes, the Bed & Breakfast package would be $412 CAD/night + taxes. This includes breakfast for two adults and parking
Agent: Certainly!
User: thanks for all the info; have a great day.  good-bye :)

Having difficulty finding hotel in Copenhagen. Do have some flexibility on dates so thought I would email directly. 

* Arriving May 26th ( though it's a red eye, so would consider booking May 25th so we have a place to go when we land on the 26th)
* Wanting to stay for 2-3 nights
* Would need 2 rooms - 1 for myself & baby and a second for a friend

Do you have availability?

Newuser: I do not understand what over ride means
Agent: Greetings from Impiana KLCC Hotel. For room bookings please do visit our website http://kualalumpurhotels.impiana.com.my/
Agent: How many nights for would you be looking to stay with us?
User: do I book from the 6 and try to find another room or what do you suggest
Agent: Thank you for your inquiry & have a good day ahead.
User: It will be two nights, a brief trip.
Agent: Do you have a direct number I can reach you at? I can help you make this reservation for you if you like.
Agent: Could you be a little more specific regarding the month you would prefer?
User: shall I book from the 6 then
User: That's the thing, we can travel anytime so we're willing to work around your cheapest months.  I see from checking availability on the website that it's £533 for two nights mid week in September (romance package) for example.  That's the cheapest I've seen it
User: I was going to make the reservation from the 6 as it shows on my computer
Agent: Very interesting! I am looking at the month of September and the lowest price for a Jacuzzi Suite I can see is £391 per night and that would not include the Romance Package. The cheapest option I am able to locate would be weekdays in January available at £289 per night for our Flexible Best Available Rate.
Agent: Okay then you can do it that
User: Maybe I was looking at the wrong results!  The information you've provided is very useful, thank you very much!  I'll get in touch when we decide to make a booking.

User: will you help me with the 5th of august
User: That's wonderful!  Out of interest, what is the difference between your jacuzzi suites?  I see on the website that each is slightly different.  Does one have a better view, larger TV etc...?  I can't find many photos of the room on the website, just angles of the jacuzzi
User: after I book from the 6
User: Also, one of the photos shows a huge number of candles around the bath (I love it)!  Would we actually have all of those candles?
User: Ms. Tammy are you still here?
Agent: All of our rooms are different in regards to their design etc., however, they all feature same amenities. We do not guarantee specific rooms to be available in case of unforeseen circumstances such as maintenance issues etc.
User: the other phone land is 002023630891
Agent: The candles in question would be a part of our Romantic Turndown which is priced at additional £20.
Agent: Yes
User: To clarify are these jacuzzi baths or actual hot tubs that are always filled and hot and ready to jump in to?
Agent: I will call you soon

Newuser: We stayed with you last winter and I think rate including parking for 14 days was much cheaper.  Is $259 for 20 days parking the best you can do?

User: It is Early bird rate as it is more than 30 days in advance

Newuser: April 17.  Park until evening of May 6.

Agent: We need to ask for a credit card to secure the booking . At check-in you'll have to provide a credit card to swipe for deposit and incidentals.

Newuser: Apologies for asking a question so late at night- does your hotel have any rooms with two single beds instead of a double bed? I was looking for a room 8.08.17 to 11.08.17 for me and my mother for her 80th birthday- fist time in Copenhagen, but a double bed would be a bit difficult...thank you in advance for your help! Bettina
User: Hi, Can I please check my booking?
User: or 7.08.17 to the 10th
User: My husband booked my sister in law, my niece and myself into the hotel for 1 night but cant find the reservation number, its booked under the name Shaw, regards
Agent: Good evening, yes we do have availabilities on your requested dates. As far as two single (twin beds) beds goes, we can accomodate you by booking one of our Wonder Double or Brilliant Double rooms. Hope that is the answer you were looking for.
Agent: Can I ask what the First name would be?
User: Thank you- I am just checking the price difference between the standard room and the ones you mentioned
User: That is a real shame- it's 600 Krona per night more for a twin bed?

Newuser: Unfortunately that puts your hotel outside my price range- that is really a shame.
User: If you do find that you have a 'cool room' where the beds can be divided, please do let me know - I preferred your hotel above the others I researched and would be most happy if you have a cancellation and there is a twin room (or one that can be 'rearranged' as a twin)
User: My email address is Bettina.Suarez@hotmail.com
User: Could you let me know that you have received my email address? Then I'll close the chat- wishing you a lovely weekend!
Agent: Hello again - due to Fashion week in Copenhagen on the requested dates we have only got a very few rooms left and therefore no Cool Standard rooms left. Sorry for that. Have a nice day
User: Oh, I did not realise we had chosen such a bud´sy week (I just assumed summer was always busy) thank you for letting me know! But just in case- even if it it only a few days before, and if you remember me- if there is a cancellation, I'd be happy to take it!
User: Have a lovely weekend!
Agent: I will....
User: thanks!!

Agent: The ticket office is located in Terminal 3 above the railway station. There are lifts and travolators between the platforms and Terminal 3. You can take the free shuttle bus, which runs between Terminal 1 and Terminal 3, where the station is located. The bus journey lasts about 5 minutes.

IMPORTANT: Please check that you are boarding the correct train, as it is possible to board trains, which run to Sweden directly. 

When you arrive at Copenhagen Main Station (Hovedbanen St/Copenhagen Central station)
Choose the exit located next to the Police (Politi) Station and Post office, to Reventlowsgade. 
Cross over the small zebra crossing and turn left into the road marked Istedgade. The Andersen Boutique Hotel is located 3 min. walk down Istedgade on the right hand side.

Agent: Thank you for your inquiry & have a good day ahead.
Agent: You can also take public transit which is less expensive at $2.50, however it requires a transfer as well as a ten minute walk, which may be uncomfortable depending on how much luggage you have. You would take the #80 from the Airport and connect to the #70 in Sidney, travel into downtown Victoria and then get off  at Douglas at Bellville and walk the rest of the way. The best way to find times is by following directions on BC Transit's website: http://www.busonline.ca/regions/vic/tripplanner.cfm

Agent: Parking can be challenging downtown, but you will be able to walk to most areas with ease from the hotel.

Newuser: It's reasonable that you have to do construction, but a heads-up at check-in that it would be starting right outside the room at 8:00 am would have been good at check-in. If there were any empty rooms available, one not immediately beside the construction would have been even better. Other than that, it's been a good stay!

User: A room for two adults
Agent: I do apologize. While we have a letter posted on the Front Desk as well as in each room, they are supposed to inform us prior to working on our street so that we are able to inform our guests at check in.

We have taken this up with the Chief Engineer of the project as well as the damage they have caused to our driveway. I am so sorry that they have taken away from your experience with us.

Agent: Hi Pat, thank you for your message. I apologize for the confusion; hopefully I can help. We've just recently changed our policies regarding advance purchase bookings, to make them more flexible.

On my way out the door now, so will check back later to see if you've answered. Thx again. Pat

User: I was really happy with those rates until I seen the $50 in taxes and another $50 for parking.

Newuser: I need to parking to an existing reservation for 5nights - how much would that cost?
Agent: Yes, taxes in Chicago are pretty high for all hotels, at 17.4%. Our parking at $25 a day may seem like a lot, but is reasonable for Chicago with in & out access, hotels downtown charge upwards of $50 a night. I'm afraid we cannot be flexible with taxes or parking at all
